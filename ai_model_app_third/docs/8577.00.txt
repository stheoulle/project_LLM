How breast cancer starts
Breast cancer occurs almost entirely in women, but men can get breast cancer1, too.
Cancer starts when cells begin to grow out of control. (To learn more about how
cancers start and spread, see What Is Cancer?2)
It’s important to understand that most breast lumps are benign and not cancer
(malignant). Non-cancer breast tumors are abnormal growths, but they do not spread
outside of the breast. They are not life threatening, but some types of benign breast
lumps can increase a woman's risk of getting breast cancer.
Any breast lump or change needs to be checked by a health care professional to find
out if it is benign or malignant (cancer) and if it might affect your future cancer risk. See
Non-cancerous Breast Conditions3 to learn more.
Where breast cancer starts
Breast cancers can start from different parts of the breast. The breast is an organ that
sits on top of the upper ribs and chest muscles. There is a left and right breast and each
one has mainly glands, ducts, and fatty tissue. In women, the breast makes and delivers
milk to feed newborns and infants. The amount of fatty tissue in the breast determines
the size of each breast.
The breast has different parts:
2
_A_m__e_ri_ca_n_ _C_a_n_c_e_r_ S_o_c_i_e_ty_________________________________________c_a_n_c_e_r._o_rg_ _| _1_.8_0_0_._2_2_7_.2_3_4_5__
Lobules are the glands that make breast milk. Cancers that start here are called
l
lobular cancers.
Ducts are small canals that come out from the lobules and carry the milk to the
l
nipple. This is the most common place for breast cancer to start. Cancers that start
here are called ductal cancers.
The nipple is the opening in the skin of the breast where the ducts come together
l
and turn into larger ducts so the milk can leave the breast. The nipple is surrounded
by slightly darker thicker skin called the areola. A less common type of breast
cancer called Paget disease of the breast can start in the nipple.
The fat and connective tissue (stroma) surround the ducts and lobules and help
l
keep them in place. A less common type of breast cancer called phyllodes tumor4
can start in the stroma.
Blood vessels and lymph vessels are also found in each breast. Angiosarcoma is
l
a less common type of breast cancer that can start in the lining of these vessels.
The lymph system is described below.
A small number of cancers start in other tissues in the breast. These cancers are called
sarcomas5 and lymphomas6 and are not really thought of as breast cancers.
To learn more, see Types of Breast Cancer.

How breast cancer spreads
Breast cancer can spread when the cancer cells get into the blood or lymph system and
then are carried to other parts of the body.
The lymph (or lymphatic) system is a part of your body's immune system. It is a network
of lymph nodes (small, bean-sized glands), ducts or vessels, and organs that work
together to collect and carry clear lymph fluid through the body tissues to the blood. The
clear lymph fluid inside the lymph vessels contains tissue by-products and waste
material, as well as immune system cells.
The lymph vessels carry lymph fluid away from the breast. In the case of breast cancer,
cancer cells can enter those lymph vessels and start to grow in lymph nodes. Most of
the lymph vessels of the breast drain into:

Lymph nodes under the arm (axillary lymph nodes)
l
Lymph nodes inside the chest near the breastbone (internal mammary lymph
l
nodes)
Lymph nodes around the collar bone (supraclavicular [above the collar bone] and
l
infraclavicular [below the collar bone] lymph nodes)
If cancer cells have spread to your lymph nodes, there is a higher chance that the cells
could have traveled through the lymph system and spread (metastasized) to other parts
of your body. Still, not all women with cancer cells in their lymph nodes develop
metastases, and some women with no cancer cells in their lymph nodes might develop
metastases later.

Types of breast cancer
There are many different types of breast cancer. The type is determined by the specific
kind of cells in the breast that are affected. Most breast cancers are carcinomas. The

most common breast cancers such as ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and invasive
carcinoma are adenocarcinomas, since the cancers start in the gland cells in the milk
ducts or the lobules (milk-producing glands). Other kinds of cancers can grow in the
breast, like angiosarcoma or sarcoma7, but are not considered breast cancer since they
start in different cells of the breast.
Breast cancers are also classified by certain types of proteins or genes each cancer
might make. After a biopsy is done, breast cancer cells are tested for proteins called
estrogen receptors and progesterone receptors8, and the HER2 gene or protein9. The
tumor cells are also closely looked at in the lab to find out what grade10 it is. The specific
proteins found and the tumor grade can help decide the stage of the cancer and
treatment options.
To learn more about the specific tests done on breast cancer cells, see Understanding a
Breast Cancer Diagnosis11.

What Causes Breast Cancer?
We don't know what causes each case of breast cancer. But we do know many of the
risk factors for these cancers. We also know that normal breast cells can become
cancer because of changes or mutations in genes. Hormones also seem to play a role
in many cases of breast cancer, but just how this happens is not fully understood.

Lifestyle-related risk factors
Lifestyle-related risk factors, such as what you eat and how much you exercise, can
increase your chance of developing breast cancer, but it’s not yet known exactly how
some of these risk factors cause normal cells to become cancer.

Cannot Change2.

Hormones
Hormones also seem to play a role in many cases of breast cancer, but just how this
happens is not fully understood.
Gene mutations
We do know that normal breast cells can become cancer because of changes or
mutations in genes. But only about 1 in 10 breast cancers (10%) are linked with known
abnormal genes that are passed on from parents (inherited). Many genes have not yet
been discovered, so women with a family history of breast cancer might have inherited
an abnormal gene that doesn't show on a genetic test3. Most breast cancers (about
90%) develop from acquired (not inherited) gene changes that have not yet been
identified.
How gene changes can lead to breast cancer
Genes4 control how our cells function. They are made up of a chemical called DNA,
which comes from both our parents. DNA affects more than just how we look; it also can
influence our risk for developing certain diseases, including some kinds of cancer.
Normal cells have genes called proto-oncogenes, which help control when the cells
grow, divide to make new cells, or stay alive. If a proto-oncogene is mutated (changed)
in a certain way, it becomes an oncogene. Cells that have these mutated oncogenes
can become cancer.
Normal cells also have genes called tumor suppressor genes, which help control how
often normal cells divide in two, repair DNA mistakes, or cause cells to die at the right
time. If a cell has a mutated tumor suppressor gene, then the cell can turn into cancer.
Cancers can be caused by gene changes that turn on oncogenes or turn off tumor
suppressor genes. Changes in many different genes are usually needed to cause
breast cancer.
Inherited gene changes
Some gene changes (mutations) are inherited or passed to you from your
parents. This means the mutations are in all your cells when you are born.
Certain inherited gene changes can greatly increase the risk for developing certain
9
_A_m__e_ri_ca_n_ _C_a_n_c_e_r_ S_o_c_i_e_ty_________________________________________c_a_n_c_e_r._o_rg_ _| _1_.8_0_0_._2_2_7_.2_3_4_5__
cancers and are linked to many of the cancers that run in some families. For instance,
the BRCA genes (BRCA1 and BRCA2) are tumor suppressor genes. When one of
these genes changes, it no longer suppresses abnormal cell growth, and cancer is more
likely to develop. A change in one of these genes can be passed from a parent to a
child.
Women have already begun to benefit from advances in understanding the genetic
basis of breast cancer. Genetic testing can identify some women who have inherited
mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 tumor suppressor genes as well as other less
common genes such as PALB2, ATM, or CHEK2. These women can then take steps to
reduce their risk of breast cancer by increasing awareness of their breasts and following
appropriate screening recommendations5 to help find cancer at an earlier, more
treatable stage. Since these mutations are also often associated with other cancers
(besides breast), women with these mutations might also consider early screening and
preventive actions for other cancers.
Mutations in tumor suppressor genes like the BRCA genes are considered “high
penetrance” because they often lead to cancer. Although many women with high
penetrance mutations develop cancer, most cases of cancer (including breast cancer)
are not caused by this kind of mutation.
More often, low-penetrance mutations or gene variations are a factor in cancer
development. Each of these may have a small effect on cancer occurring in any one
person, but the overall effect on the population can be large because the mutations are
common, and people often have more than one at the same time. The genes involved
can affect things like hormone levels, metabolism, or other factors that impact risk for
breast cancer. These genes might also cause much of the risk of breast cancer that
runs in families.
Acquired gene changes
Most gene mutations linked to breast cancer are acquired. This means the change
takes place in breast cells during a person's life rather than having been inherited or
born with them. Acquired DNA mutations take place over time and are only in the breast
cancer cells.
These acquired mutations of oncogenes and/or tumor suppressor genes may result
from other factors, like radiation or cancer-causing chemicals. But some gene changes
may just be random events that sometimes happen inside a cell, without having an
outside cause. So far, the causes of most acquired mutations that could lead to breast
cancer are still unknown. Most breast cancers have several acquired gene mutations.

Types of Breast Cancer
There are many types of breast cancer, and many different ways to describe them. It’s
easy to get confused.
A breast cancer's type is determined by the specific cells in the breast that
become cancer.
Ductal or lobular carcinoma
l
Less common types of breast cancer
l
Ductal or lobular carcinoma
Most breast cancers are carcinomas, which are tumors that start in the epithelial cells
that line organs and tissues throughout the body. When carcinomas form in the breast,
they are usually a more specific type called adenocarcinoma, which starts in cells in
the ducts (the milk ducts) or the lobules (glands in the breast that make milk).
In situ vs. invasive breast cancers
The type of breast cancer can also refer to whether the cancer has spread or not. In
situ breast cancer (ductal carcinoma in situ or DCIS) is a pre-cancer that starts in a
milk duct and has not grown into the rest of the breast tissue. The term invasive (or
infiltrating) breast cancer is used to describe any type of breast cancer that has spread
(invaded) into the surrounding breast tissue.
Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)
Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS; also known as intraductal carcinoma) is a non-invasive
or pre-invasive breast cancer.
Invasive breast cancer (ILC or IDC)
Invasive (or infiltrating) breast cancer has spread into surrounding breast tissue. The
most common types are invasive ductal carcinoma and invasive lobular
carcinoma. Invasive ductal carcinoma makes up about 70-80% of all breast cancers.
Special types of invasive breast cancers
Some invasive breast cancers have special features or develop in different ways that
influence their treatment and outlook. These cancers are less common but can be more
serious than other types of breast cancer.

Triple-negative breast cancer
Triple-negative breast cancer is an aggressive type of invasive breast cancer in which
the cancer cells don’t have estrogen or progesterone receptors (ER or PR) and also
don’t make any or too much of the protein called HER2. (The cells test "negative" on all
3 tests.) It accounts for about 15% of all breast cancers and can be a difficult cancer to
treat.
Inflammatory breast cancer
Inflammatory breast cancer is an aggressive type of invasive breast cancer in which
cancer cells block lymph vessels in the skin, causing the breast to look "inflamed." It is
rare and accounts for about 1% to 5% of all breast cancers.
Less common types of breast cancer
There are other types of breast cancers that start to grow in other types of cells in the
breast. These cancers are much less common, and sometimes need different types of
treatment.
Paget disease of the breast
Paget disease of the breast is rare, accounting for only about 1-3% of all cases of
breast cancer. It starts in the breast ducts and spreads to the skin of the nipple and
then to the areola (the dark circle around the nipple).
Angiosarcoma
Sarcomas of the breast are rare making up less than 1% of all breast
cancers. Angiosarcoma starts in cells that line blood vessels or lymph vessels. It can
involve the breast tissue or the skin of the breast. Some may be related to prior
radiation therapy in that area.
Phyllodes tumor
Phyllodes tumors are rare breast tumors. They develop in the connective tissue
(stroma) of the breast, in contrast to carcinomas, which develop in the ducts or lobules.
Most are benign, but there are others that are malignant (cancer).

Ductal Carcinoma in Situ (DCIS)
Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a non-invasive or pre-invasive breast cancer. It is
also known as intraductal carcinoma.
Treating DCIS
l
About 1 in 5 new breast cancers will be ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Nearly all
women with this early stage of breast cancer can be cured.
DCIS is also called intraductal carcinoma or stage 0 breast cancer. DCIS is a non-
invasive or pre-invasive breast cancer. This means the cells that line the ducts have
changed to cancer cells but they have not spread through the walls of the ducts into the
nearby breast tissue.
15

Because DCIS hasn’t spread into the breast tissue around it, it can’t spread
(metastasize) beyond the breast to other parts of the body.
However, DCIS can sometimes become an invasive cancer. At that time, the cancer
has spread out of the duct into nearby tissue, and from there, it could metastasize to
other parts of the body.
Right now, there’s no good way to know for sure which will become invasive cancer and
which ones won’t, so almost all women with DCIS will be treated.

In most cases, a woman with DCIS can choose between breast-conserving surgery
(BCS) and simple mastectomy. Radiation is usually given after BCS. Tamoxifen or an
aromatase inhibitor after surgery might also be an option if the DCIS is hormone-
receptor positive1.

Invasive Breast Cancer (IDC/ILC)
Breast cancers that have spread into surrounding breast tissue are known as invasive
breast cancers. Most breast cancers are invasive, but there are different types of
invasive breast cancer. The two most common types are invasive ductal carcinoma
(IDC) and invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC).
Inflammatory breast cancer and triple negative breast cancer are also types of
invasive breast cancer.

Invasive (infiltrating) ductal carcinoma (IDC)
This is the most common type of breast cancer. About 8 in 10 invasive breast cancers
are invasive (or infiltrating) ductal carcinomas (IDC).
IDC starts in the cells that line a milk duct in the breast. From there, the cancer breaks
through the wall of the duct, and grows into the nearby breast tissues. At this point, it
may be able to spread (metastasize) to other parts of the body through the lymph
system and bloodstream.
Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC)
About 1 in 10 invasive breast cancers is an invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC).
ILC starts in the breast glands that make milk (lobules). Like IDC, it can spread

(metastasize) to other parts of the body. Invasive lobular carcinoma may be harder to
detect on physical exam and imaging, like mammograms, than invasive ductal
carcinoma. And compared to other kinds of invasive carcinoma, it is more likely to affect
both breasts. About 1 in 5 women with ILC might have cancer in both breasts at the
time they are diagnosed.
Less common types of invasive breast cancer
There are some special types of breast cancer that are sub-types of invasive
carcinoma. They are less common than the breast cancers named above and each
typically make up fewer than 5% of all breast cancers. These are often named after
features of the cancer cells, like the ways the cells are arranged.
Some of these may have a better prognosis than the more common IDC. These include:
Adenoid cystic (or adenocystic) carcinoma
l
Low-grade adenosquamous carcinoma (this is a type of metaplastic carcinoma)
l
Medullary carcinoma
l
Mucinous (or colloid) carcinoma
l
Papillary carcinoma
l
Tubular carcinoma
l
Some sub-types have the same or maybe worse prognoses than IDC. These include:
Metaplastic carcinoma (most types, including spindle cell and squamous, except
l
low grade adenosquamous carcinoma)
Micropapillary carcinoma
l
Mixed carcinoma (has features of both invasive ductal and invasive lobular)
l
In general, all of these sub-types are still treated like IDC.
Treating invasive breast cancer
Treatment of invasive breast cancer depends on how advanced the cancer is (the stage
of the cancer) and other factors. Most women will have some type of surgery to remove
the tumor. Depending on the type of breast cancer and how advanced it is, you might
need other types of treatment as well, either before or after surgery, or sometimes both.
See Treating Breast Cancer1 for details on different types of treatment, as well as

Triple-negative Breast Cancer
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive type of invasive breast cancer.
20
_A_m__e_ri_ca_n_ _C_a_n_c_e_r_ S_o_c_i_e_ty_________________________________________c_a_n_c_e_r._o_rg_ _| _1_.8_0_0_._2_2_7_.2_3_4_5__
TNBC differs from other types of invasive breast cancer in that it tends to grow and
spread faster, has fewer treatment options, and tends to have a worse prognosis
(outlook).
The term triple-negative breast cancer refers to the fact that the cancer cells don’t
have estrogen or progesterone receptors1 (ER or PR) and also don’t have too much of
the HER22 protein. (The cells test "negative" on all 3 tests.)

How common is triple-negative breast cancer?
Triple-negative breast cancer accounts for about 10-15% of all breast cancers. These
cancers tend to be more common in women younger than age 40, who are Black, or
who have a BRCA1 mutation.
Signs and symptoms of triple-negative breast cancer
Triple-negative breast cancer can have the same signs and symptoms3 as other
common types of breast cancer.
How is triple-negative breast cancer diagnosed?
Once a breast cancer diagnosis has been made using imaging tests and a biopsy4, the
cancer cells will be checked for certain proteins. If the cells do not have estrogen or
progesterone receptors (ER or PR), and also do not have too much of the HER2
protein, the cancer is considered to be triple-negative breast cancer.
Survival rates for triple-negative breast cancer
TNBC tends to grow quickly, is more likely to have spread at the time it’s found, and is
more likely to come back after treatment than other types of breast cancer. Because of
this, the survival rates for TNBC are generally not quite as high as they are for other
types of breast cancer.
21
_A_m__e_ri_ca_n_ _C_a_n_c_e_r_ S_o_c_i_e_ty_________________________________________c_a_n_c_e_r._o_rg_ _| _1_.8_0_0_._2_2_7_.2_3_4_5__
Survival rates can give you an idea of what percentage of people with the same type
and stage of cancer are still alive a certain amount of time (usually 5 years) after they
were diagnosed. They can’t tell you how long you will live, but they may help give you a
better understanding of how likely it is that your treatment will be successful.
Keep in mind that survival rates are estimates and are often based on previous
outcomes of large numbers of people who had a specific cancer, but they can’t
predict what will happen in any particular person’s case. These statistics can be
confusing and may lead you to have more questions. Talk with your doctor about
how these numbers may apply to you, as they are familiar with your situation.
What is a 5-year relative survival rate?
A relative survival rate compares women with the same type and stage of breast
cancer to women in the overall population. For example, if the 5-year relative survival
rate for a specific stage of breast cancer is 90%, it means that women who have that
cancer are, on average, about 90% as likely as women who don’t have that cancer to
live for at least 5 years after being diagnosed.
Where do these numbers come from?
The American Cancer Society relies on information from the Surveillance,
Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER) database, maintained by the National
Cancer Institute (NCI), to provide survival statistics for different types of cancer.
The SEER database tracks 5-year relative survival rates for breast cancer in the United
States, based on how far the cancer has spread. The SEER database, however, does
not group cancers by AJCC TNM stages5 (stage 1, stage 2, stage 3, etc.). Instead, it
groups cancers into localized, regional, and distant stages:
Localized: There is no sign that the cancer has spread outside of the breast.
l
Regional: The cancer has spread outside the breast to nearby structures or lymph
l
nodes.
Distant: The cancer has spread to distant parts of the body such as the lungs, liver,
l
or bones.
5-year relative survival rates for triple-negative breast cancer
These numbers are based on women diagnosed with TNBC between 2015 and 2021.

SEER Stage 5-year Relative Survival Rate
Localized 92%
Regional 67%
Distant 15%
78%
All stages combined
Understanding the numbers
Women now being diagnosed with TNBC may have a better outlook than
l
these numbers show. Treatments improve over time, and these numbers are
based on women who were diagnosed and treated at least 5 years earlier.
These numbers apply only to the stage of the cancer when it is first
l
diagnosed. They do not apply later on if the cancer grows, spreads, or comes back
after treatment.
These numbers don’t take everything into account. Survival rates are grouped
l
based on how far the cancer has spread, but your age and overall health, how well
the cancer responds to treatment, tumor grade6, and other factors can also affect
your outlook.
Treating triple-negative breast cancer
Triple-negative breast cancer has fewer treatment options than other types of invasive
breast cancer. This is because the cancer cells do not have the estrogen or
progesterone receptors or enough of the HER2 protein to make hormone therapy or
HER2-targeted drugs work. Because hormone therapy and anti-HER2 drugs are not
choices for women with triple-negative breast cancer, chemotherapy is often used.
If the cancer has not spread to distant sites, surgery is an option. Chemotherapy might
be given first to shrink a large tumor, followed by surgery. Chemotherapy is often
recommended after surgery to reduce the chances of the cancer coming back.
Radiation might also be an option depending on certain features of the tumor and the
type of surgery you had.
In cases where the cancer has spread to other parts of the body (stage IV), platinum
chemotherapy, targeted drugs like a PARP inhibitor or antibody-drug conjugate, or

immunotherapy with chemotherapy might be considered.

Inflammatory Breast Cancer
Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is a rare and aggressive type of invasive breast
cancer in which cancer cells block lymph vessels in the skin. This causes the breast to
look “inflamed.”

Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is rare. It accounts for only 1% to 5% of all breast
cancers. Although it is a type of invasive ductal carcinoma, its symptoms, outlook, and
treatment are different. IBC causes symptoms of breast inflammation like swelling and
redness, which is caused by cancer cells blocking lymph vessels in the skin causing the
breast to look "inflamed."
Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) differs from other types of breast cancer in many
ways:
IBC doesn't look like a typical breast cancer. It often does not cause a breast lump,
l
and it might not show up on a mammogram. This makes it harder to diagnose.
IBC tends to occur in younger women (younger than 40 years of age).
l
Black women appear to develop IBC more often than White women.
l
IBC is more common among women who have excess body weight (overweight or
l
obesity).
IBC tends to be more aggressive—it grows and spreads much more quickly—than
l
more common types of breast cancer.
IBC is always at least at a locally advanced stage when it’s first diagnosed because
l
the breast cancer cells have grown into the skin. (This means it is at least stage III.)
In about 1 of 3 cases, IBC has already spread (metastasized) to distant parts of the
l
body when it is diagnosed. This makes it harder to treat successfully.
Women with IBC tend to have a worse prognosis (outcome) than women with other
l
common types of breast cancer.
Signs and symptoms of inflammatory breast cancer
Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) can cause a number of signs and symptoms, most of
which develop quickly (within 3 to 6 months), including:
Swelling (edema) of the skin of the breast
l
Redness involving more than one-third of the breast
l
Pitting or thickening of the skin of the breast so that it may look and feel like an
l
orange peel
A retracted or inverted nipple
l
One breast looking larger than the other because of swelling
l
One breast feeling warmer and heavier than the other
l
A breast that may be tender, painful, or itchy
l
Swelling of the lymph nodes under the arms or near the collarbone
l
26

If you have any of these symptoms, it does not mean that you have IBC, but you should
see a doctor right away. Tenderness, redness, warmth, and itching are also common
symptoms of a breast infection or inflammation, such as mastitis1 if you’re pregnant or
breastfeeding. Because these problems are much more common than IBC, your doctor
might suspect infection at first as a cause and treat you with antibiotics.
Treatment with antibiotics may be a good first step, but if your symptoms don’t get
better in 7 to 10 days, more tests need to be done to look for cancer. Let your doctor
know if it doesn't help, especially if the symptoms get worse or the affected area gets
larger. The possibility of IBC should be considered more strongly if you have these
symptoms and are not pregnant or breastfeeding, or have been through menopause.
Ask to see a specialist (like a breast surgeon) if you’re concerned.
IBC grows and spreads quickly, so the cancer may have already spread to nearby
lymph nodes by the time symptoms are noticed. This spread can cause swollen lymph

nodes under your arm or above your collar bone. If the diagnosis is delayed, the cancer
can spread to distant sites.
How is inflammatory breast cancer diagnosed?
Imaging tests
If inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is suspected, one or more of the following imaging
tests may be done:
Mammogram2
l
Breast ultrasound3
l
Breast MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan4
l
Often a photo of the breast is taken to help record the amount of redness and swelling
before starting treatment.
Biopsy
Inflammatory breast cancer is diagnosed by a biopsy5, taking out a small piece of the
breast tissue and looking at it in the lab. This might mean a punch biopsy6 of the breast
skin that is abnormal. Your physical exam and other tests may show findings that are
"suspicious for" IBC, but only a biopsy can tell for sure that it is cancer.
Tests on biopsy samples
The cancer cells in the biopsy will be examined in the lab to determine their grade7.
They will also be tested for certain proteins that help decide which treatments will be
helpful. Women whose breast cancer cells have hormone receptors8 are likely to benefit
from treatment with hormone therapy drugs.
Cancer cells that make too much of a protein called HER29 or too many copies of the
gene for that protein may be treated by certain drugs that target HER2.
In certain cases, other gene mutations (changes) or proteins10 might be tested for to see
if specific drugs might be helpful.
Stages of inflammatory breast cancer
28
_A_m__e_ri_ca_n_ _C_a_n_c_e_r_ S_o_c_i_e_ty_________________________________________c_a_n_c_e_r._o_rg_ _| _1_.8_0_0_._2_2_7_.2_3_4_5__
All inflammatory breast cancers start as stage III (T4dNXM0) since they involve the
skin. If the cancer has spread outside the breast to distant parts of the body, it is stage
IV.
For more information, read about breast cancer staging11.
Survival rates for inflammatory breast cancer
Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) tends to grow quickly, is more likely to have spread at
the time it’s found, and is more likely to come back after treatment than most other
types of breast cancer. Because of this, the survival rates are generally not as high as
they are for other types of breast cancer.
Survival rates can give you an idea of what percentage of people with the same type
and stage of cancer are still alive a certain amount of time (usually 5 years) after they
were diagnosed. They can’t tell you how long you will live, but they may help give you a
better understanding of how likely it is that your treatment will be successful.
Keep in mind that survival rates are estimates and are often based on previous
outcomes of large numbers of people who had a specific cancer, but they can’t
predict what will happen in any particular person’s case. These statistics can be
confusing and may lead you to have more questions. Ask your doctor how these
numbers may apply to you, as they are familiar with your situation.
What is a 5-year relative survival rate?
A relative survival rate compares women with the same type and stage of breast
cancer to women in the overall population. For example, if the 5-year relative survival
rate for a specific stage of breast cancer is 70%, it means that women who have that
cancer are, on average, about 70% as likely as women who don’t have that cancer to
live for at least 5 years after being diagnosed.
Where do these numbers come from?
The American Cancer Society relies on information from the Surveillance,
Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, maintained by the National Cancer

groups cancers into localized, regional, and distant stages:
Localized: There is no sign that the cancer has spread outside of the breast.
l
Regional: The cancer has spread outside the breast to nearby structures or lymph
l
nodes.
Distant: The cancer has spread to distant parts of the body such as the lungs, liver,
l
or bones.
5-year relative survival rates for inflammatory breast cancer
These numbers are based on women diagnosed with IBC between 2015 and 2021.
(There is no localized SEER stage for IBC since it has already reached the skin when
first diagnosed.)
SEER Stage 5-year Relative Survival Rate
Regional 53%
Distant 22%
All SEER Stages 40%
Understanding the numbers
Women now being diagnosed with inflammatory breast cancer may have a
l
better outlook than these numbers show. Treatments improve over time, and
these numbers are based on women who were diagnosed and treated at least 5
years earlier.
These numbers apply only to the stage of the cancer when it is first
l
diagnosed. They do not apply later on if the cancer grows, spreads, or comes back
after treatment.
These numbers don’t take everything into account. Survival rates are grouped
l
based on how far the cancer has spread, but your age and overall health, how well
the cancer responds to treatment, tumor grade13, and other factors can also affect
your outlook.
Treating inflammatory breast cancer
Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) that has not spread outside the breast is stage III. In

most cases, treatment is chemotherapy first to try to shrink the tumor, followed by
surgery to remove the cancer. Radiation and often other treatments, like more
chemotherapy or targeted drug therapy, are given after surgery. Because IBC is so
aggressive, breast conserving surgery (lumpectomy) and sentinel lymph node biopsy
are typically not part of the treatment.
IBC that has spread to other parts of the body (stage IV) may be treated with
chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and/or targeted drugs.

Angiosarcoma of the Breast
Angiosarcoma is a rare cancer that starts in the cells that line blood vessels or lymph
vessels. It is often a complication of previous radiation treatment to the breast. It can
happen 8-10 years after getting radiation treatment to the breast.

Signs and symptoms of angiosarcoma
Angiosarcoma can cause skin changes like purple colored nodules and/or a lump in the
breast. It can also occur in the affected arms of women with lymphedema, but this is not
common. (Lymphedema1 is swelling that can develop after surgery or radiation therapy
to treat breast cancer.)
How is angiosarcoma of the breast diagnosed?
One or more of the following imaging tests may be done to check for breast changes:
Diagnostic mammogram2
l
Breast ultrasound3
l
Breast MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan4
l
Angiosarcoma is diagnosed by a biopsy5, removing a small piece of the breast tissue
and looking at it closely in the lab. Only a biopsy can tell for sure that it is cancer.
Treating angiosarcoma
Angiosarcomas tend to grow and spread quickly. Treatment usually includes surgery6 to
remove the breast (mastectomy). The axillary lymph nodes are typically not
removed. Radiation7 might be given in certain cases of angiosarcomas that are not
related to prior breast radiation. For more information on sarcomas, see Soft Tissue
Sarcoma8.

Paget Disease of the Breast
Paget disease of the breast is a rare type of breast cancer involving the skin of the
nipple and the areola (the dark circle around the nipple).
Signs and symptoms of Paget disease of the breast
l
How is Paget disease of the breast diagnosed?
l
Treating Paget disease of the breast
l
Signs and symptoms of Paget disease of the breast
The skin of the nipple and areola often looks crusted, scaly, and red. There may be
blood or yellow fluid coming out of the nipple. Sometimes the nipple looks flat or
inverted. It also might burn or itch. Your doctor might try to treat this as eczema first,
and if it does not improve, recommend a biopsy.
Paget disease usually affects only one breast. In 80-90% of cases, it’s usually found
along with either ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or infiltrating ductal carcinoma
(invasive breast cancer).
How is Paget disease of the breast diagnosed?
Most people with Paget disease of the breast also have tumors in the same breast. One
or more of the following imaging tests may be done to check for other breast changes:
Diagnostic mammogram1
l
Breast ultrasound2
l
Breast MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan3
l
Paget disease of the breast is diagnosed by a biopsy4, removing a small piece of the
breast tissue and looking at it closely in the lab. In some cases, the entire nipple may be
removed. Only a biopsy can show for sure that it is cancer.
Treating Paget disease of the breast
Paget disease can be treated by removing the entire breast (mastectomy5) or breast-
conserving surgery6 (BCS) followed by whole-breast radiation therapy7. If BCS is done,
the entire nipple and areola area also needs to be removed. If invasive cancer is found,

the lymph nodes under the arm will be checked for cancer.
If no lump is felt in the breast tissue, and your biopsy results show the cancer has not
spread within the breast tissue, the outlook (prognosis) is excellent.
If the cancer has spread within the breast tissue (is invasive), the outlook is not as good,
and the cancer will be staged8 and treated like any other invasive ductal carcinoma9.

Phyllodes Tumors of the Breast

Diagnosis of phyllodes tumors

How do phyllodes tumors affect your risk for breast cancer?
l
Treatment of phyllodes tumors
l
Who is most at risk for phyllodes tumors?
Phyllodes tumors are most common in women in their 40s, but women of any age
can have them. Women with Li-Fraumeni syndrome1 (a rare, inherited genetic condition)
have an increased risk for phyllodes tumors.
Diagnosis of phyllodes tumors
Phyllodes tumors are usually felt as a firm, painless breast lump, but some may hurt.
They tend to grow large fairly quickly, and they often stretch the skin.
Sometimes these tumors are seen first on an imaging test (like an ultrasound2 or
mammogram3), in which case they’re often hard to tell apart from fibroadenomas4.
The diagnosis can often be made with a core needle biopsy5, but sometimes the entire
tumor needs to be removed (during an excisional biopsy6) to know for sure that it’s a
phyllodes tumor, and whether it's malignant or not.
How do phyllodes tumors affect your risk for breast cancer?
38
_A_m__e_ri_ca_n_ _C_a_n_c_e_r_ S_o_c_i_e_ty_________________________________________c_a_n_c_e_r._o_rg_ _| _1_.8_0_0_._2_2_7_.2_3_4_5__
Having a benign phyllodes tumor does not affect your breast cancer risk. If you have a
malignant phyllodes tumor, it does not affect your risk of getting other types of breast
cancer. Still, you may be watched more closely and get regular imaging tests after
treatment for a phyllodes tumor, because these tumors can sometimes come back after
surgery.
Treatment of phyllodes tumors
Phyllodes tumors typically need to be removed completely with surgery.
If the tumor is found to be benign, an excisional biopsy might be all that is needed, as
long as the tumor was removed completely.
If the tumor is borderline or malignant, a wider margin (area of normal tissue around
the tumor) usually needs to be removed as well. This might be done with breast-
conserving surgery7 (lumpectomy or partial mastectomy), in which part of the breast is
removed. Or the entire breast might be removed with a mastectomy8, especially if a
margin of normal breast tissue can't be taken out with breast-conserving surgery.
Radiation therapy9 might be given to the area after surgery, especially if it’s not clear
that all of the tumor was removed.
Malignant phyllodes tumors are different from the more common types of breast cancer.
They are less likely to respond to some of the treatments commonly used for breast
cancer, such as the hormone therapy10 or chemotherapy11 drugs normally used for
breast cancer. Phyllodes tumors that have spread to other parts of the body are often
treated more like sarcomas12 (soft-tissue cancers) than breast cancers.
Phyllodes tumors can sometimes come back in the same place. Because of this, close
follow-up with frequent breast exams and imaging tests are usually recommended after
treatment.

How common is breast cancer?
Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women in the United States, except for
skin cancers. It accounts for about 30% (or 1 in 3) of all new female cancers each year.
The American Cancer Society's estimates for breast cancer in the United States for
2025 are:
41
_A_m__e_ri_ca_n_ _C_a_n_c_e_r_ S_o_c_i_e_ty_________________________________________c_a_n_c_e_r._o_rg_ _| _1_.8_0_0_._2_2_7_.2_3_4_5__
About 316,950 new cases of invasive breast cancer will be diagnosed in women.
l
About 59,080 new cases of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) will be diagnosed.
l
About 42,170 women will die from breast cancer.
l
Breast cancer mainly occurs in middle-aged and older women. The median age at the
time of breast cancer diagnosis is 62. This means half of the women who developed
breast cancer are 62 years of age or younger when they are diagnosed. A very small
number of women diagnosed with breast cancer are younger than 45.
Lifetime chance of getting breast cancer
Overall, the average risk of a woman in the United States developing breast cancer
sometime in her life is about 13%. This means there is a 1 in 8 chance she will develop
breast cancer. This also means there is a 7 in 8 chance she will never have the disease.
Trends in breast cancer incidence
In recent years, incidence rates have increased by 1% per year. The rise in incidence
rates is a little steeper in women younger than 50 (1.4%). This is thought to be due to
risk factors of having excess body weight, not having children, or having a first child
after age 30.
Trends in breast cancer deaths
Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in women. (Only lung cancer
kills more women each year.) The chance that any woman will die from breast cancer is
about 1 in 43 (about 2.3%).
Breast cancer death rates have been decreasing steadily since 1989, for an overall
decline of 44% through 2022. The decrease in death rates is believed to be the result of
finding breast cancer earlier through screening and increased awareness, as well as
better treatments.
Differences by race and ethnicity
Some variations in breast cancer can be seen in racial and ethnic groups. For example:
Black women have the highest death rate from breast cancer. This is thought to be
l
42
_A_m__e_ri_ca_n_ _C_a_n_c_e_r_ S_o_c_i_e_ty_________________________________________c_a_n_c_e_r._o_rg_ _| _1_.8_0_0_._2_2_7_.2_3_4_5__
partially because Black women have a higher risk of triple-negative breast cancer,
more than any other racial or ethnic group.
At every age, Black women are more likely to die from breast cancer than any other
l
race or ethnic group.
White, Asian, and Pacific Islander women are more likely to be diagnosed with
l
localized breast cancer than Black, Hispanic, American Indian, and Alaska Native
women.
Asian and Pacific Islander women have the lowest death rate from breast cancer.
l
Breast cancer survivors
At this time there are more than 4 million breast cancer survivors in the United States.
This includes women still being treated and those who have completed treatment.
Survival rates are discussed in Survival Rates for Breast Cancer1.

What’s New in Breast Cancer Research?
Researchers around the world are working to find better ways to prevent, detect, and
treat breast cancer, and to improve the quality of life of patients and survivors.

Research studies
Current guidance on preventing and treating breast cancer as well as what might cause
it (among other things) has come mainly from information discovered from research
studies. Research studies can range from studies done in the lab to clinical trials done
with hundreds of thousands of people. Clinical trials are carefully controlled studies that
can gather specific information about certain diseases as well as explore promising new
treatments.
Clinical trials are one way to get the latest cancer treatments that are being
investigated. Still, they are not right for everyone. If you would like to learn more about
clinical trials that might be right for you, start by asking your doctor if your clinic or
hospital conducts clinical trials, or see Clinical Trials1 to learn more.
Breast cancer causes
Studies continue to look at how certain lifestyle factors, habits, and other environmental
44
_A_m__e_ri_ca_n_ _C_a_n_c_e_r_ S_o_c_i_e_ty_________________________________________c_a_n_c_e_r._o_rg_ _| _1_.8_0_0_._2_2_7_.2_3_4_5__
factors, as well as inherited gene changes, might affect breast cancer risk. Here are a
few examples:
Several studies are looking at the effects of physical activity, weight gain or loss,
l
and diet on breast cancer risk.
Some breast cancers run in families, but many of the gene mutations (changes)
l
that cause these breast cancers are not yet known. Research is being done to
identify these gene changes.
Several studies are focusing on the best use of genetic testing for inherited breast
l
cancer gene mutations.
Scientists are exploring how common gene variants (small changes in genes that
l
are not as significant as mutations) may affect breast cancer risk. Gene variants
typically have only a modest effect on risk by themselves, but when combined they
could possibly have a large impact.
Possible environmental causes of breast cancer have also received more attention
l
in recent years. While much of the science on this topic is still in its earliest stages,
this is an area of active research.
Breast cancer prevention
Researchers are looking for ways to help reduce breast cancer risk, especially for
women who are at high risk. Here are some examples:
Studies continue to look at whether certain levels of physical activity, losing weight,
l
or eating certain foods, groups of foods, or types of diets might help lower breast
cancer risk.
Some hormonal medicines2 such as tamoxifen, raloxifene, exemestane, and
l
anastrozole have already been shown to help lower breast cancer risk for certain
women at higher risk. Researchers continue to study which groups of women might
benefit most from these drugs.
Clinical trials are also looking at whether some non-hormonal drugs might lower
l
breast cancer risk, such as drugs used to treat blood or bone marrow disorders, like
ruxolitinib.
Studies are looking at vaccines that might help prevent certain types of breast
l
cancer in people who are at high risk for breast cancer (due to presence of
hereditary gene mutations or breast cancer in the family).

New tests to personalize your treatment
Biomarkers
Breast cancer tissue is routinely tested for the biomarkers ER3, PR4, and HER25 to help
make treatment decisions. A biomarker6 is any gene, protein, or other substance that
can be measured in blood, tissues, or other body fluids. Some studies are looking at
whether testing for other biomarkers, such as HER3, might also be helpful, but research
on this is still in early phases.
Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is DNA that is released into the bloodstream when
cancer cells die. Identifying and testing the ctDNA in the blood for biomarkers is a
rapidly growing area of study.
Some ways ctDNA might potentially be used in breast cancer include:
Looking for new biomarkers in the tumor cells that might mean the cancer has
l
become resistant to specific treatments (like chemo or targeted drug therapy)
Determining if a certain drug will work on a tumor before trying it
l
Predicting if the breast cancer will recur (come back) in women with early-stage
l
breast cancer
Predicting if neoadjuvant treatment is working to destroy the tumor instead of using
l
imaging tests like a CT scan or US
Determining if breast cancer or a high-risk breast condition is present before
l
changes are found on an imaging test like a mammogram
New imaging tests
Newer types of tests are being developed for breast imaging. Some of these are already
being used in certain situations, while others are still being studied. It will take time to
see if they are as good as or better than those used today. Some of these tests include:
Scintimammography (molecular breast imaging)
l
Positron emission mammography (PEM)
l
Electrical impedance imaging (EIT)
l
Elastography
l
New types of optical imaging tests
l

For more on these tests, see Newer and Experimental Breast Imaging Tests7.
Breast cancer treatment
New kinds of treatments for breast cancer are always being studied. For example, in
recent years, several new targeted drugs8 have been approved to treat breast cancer.
More and better treatment options are needed, especially for cancers like triple-negative
breast cancer, where chemotherapy is the main option.
Some areas of research involving breast cancer treatment include:
Treating patients who have hormone-positive and HER2 negative advanced breast
l
cancer with a drug that targets the estrogen receptor (ie. camizestrant) if tumor
cells were to who develop an ESR1 mutation.
Studying if shorter courses of radiation therapy for very early-stage breast cancers
l
are at least as good as the longer courses now often used
Testing if different types of radiation therapy, such as proton beam radiation, might
l
be better than standard radiation.
Combining certain drugs (like 2 targeted drugs, a targeted drug with an
l
immunotherapy drug, or a hormone drug with a targeted drug) to see if they work
better together
Trying to find new drugs or drug combinations that might help treat breast cancer
l
that has spread to the brain
Testing different immunotherapy drugs to treat triple-negative breast cancer
l
Giving cancer vaccines to see if this helps keep the cancer from either worsening or
l
coming back after treatment. There are many ways in which cancer vaccines work.
For example, protein vaccines stimulate the immune system to recognize and
attack specific cancer proteins. DNA vaccines contain DNA instructions so that
once the vaccine is given, the DNA will instruct your body to make protein(s) to help
the immune system recognize and attack cancer cells.
Finding new ways to treat women with hereditary breast cancer, since they have a
l
higher chance of the cancer recurring (coming back)
Determining if chemotherapy is needed to treat every woman with HER2-positive
l
breast cancer
Finding new treatment options when breast cancer becomes resistant to current
l
treatments

Supportive care
Supportive care helps patients and caregivers manage the symptoms of cancer and
side effects of cancer treatment. Clinical trials are looking at different medicines and
techniques to try to improve supportive care for people with breast cancer. For example,
some studies are investigating:
If there are better medicines or ways to prevent the damage to nerves9 that
l
sometimes happen with certain chemotherapy drugs
If drugs or other treatments might be helpful in limiting memory problems and
l
other brain symptoms after chemotherapy10
If certain heart or blood pressure drugs, can help prevent the heart damage
l
sometimes caused by common breast cancer drugs such as doxorubicin and
trastuzumab
If there are medicines that might be able to help treat the tired feeling that cancer
l
can cause
