NCCN FrameworkTM: Enhanced Resources
NCCN FRAMEWORK™ DEFINITIONS*
The NCCN Framework™ outlines a rational approach for building cancer management systems to provide the highest achievable
cancer care by applying available and affordable services in a logical sequence. Each NCCN Framework™ builds on the one
before it, with incremental changes to the allocation of resources, providing a structure for improving cancer care. Treatment
recommendations applicable to each NCCN Framework can be viewed within the context of the NCCN Guidelines®.
Basic Resources Basic Resources include essential services needed to provide basic minimal standard of care that
improves disease-specific outcomes.
Core Resources Core Resources include services provided in the Basic Resources Framework plus additional services
that provide major improvements in disease outcomes (eg, survival) and that are not cost prohibitive.
Enhanced Resources Enhanced Resources include services provided in the Core Resources Framework plus additional
services that provide lesser improvements in disease outcomes and/or services that provide major
improvements in disease outcomes but are cost prohibitive in lower-resource settings.
NCCN Guidelines The NCCN Guidelines are evidence-based, consensus-driven recommendations made by the NCCN
Guidelines panels. They include services provided in the Enhanced Resources Framework plus additional
services that provide minor improvements in disease outcomes, interventions that are cost prohibitive in
lower-resource settings, and/or services that do not provide improvement in disease outcomes but are
desirable services.
NCCN believes that the best available resources should be offered, including referral to a higher-resource-level provider where
feasible. If Basic Resources for cancer-specific treatment are unavailable, palliative and best supportive care should still be
provided.
* Modified from Anderson BO and Carlson RW. Guidelines for improving breast health care in limited resource countries: the Breast Health Global
Initiative. J Natl Compr Canc Netw 2007;5:349-356.
THE NCCN FRAMEWORK FOR RESOURCE STRATIFICATION IS REPRESENTED AS FOLLOWS:
Black Text: Included recommendation
Gray Text: Withheld recommendation
Italicized Blue Text: Modified recommendation for resource-constrained settings
Note: Drugs and biologics included in the NCCN FrameworkTM are approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Alternate
agents based on the local regulations and availability may be substituted provided evidence supports their efficacy and safety. Generic drugs should
be used only when studies have proven bioequivalence and the drugs have met the same standards for identity, strength, purity, and quality as the
innovator drugs. The WHO Model Lists of Essential Medicines can be found here: http://www.who.int/medicines/publications/essentialmedicines/en/.

ww FDG-PET/CT is most beneficial and accurate for advanced disease (stage III) and invasive ductal (compared to lobular) histology, but may be useful in selected
circumstances of earlier stage disease (stage IIA disease: T1N1, T2N0) such as: equivocal CT+ bone scan results; suspicion of undetected nodal and/or distant
disease; and treatment response assessment. An FDG-PET/CT may be utilized as an adjunct to, or in lieu of, initial standard staging and may be performed
simultaneously with diagnostic CT. Conversely, a bone scan or sodium fluoride PET/CT may not be needed if an upfront FDG-PET/CT clearly indicates consistent
findings on both PET and CT components.

bb Although patients with cancers with 1%–100% ER IHC staining are considered ER-positive and eligible for endocrine therapies, there are more limited data on the
subgroup of cancers with ER-low–positive (1%–10%) results. The ER-low–positive group is heterogeneous with reported biologic behavior often similar to ER-negative
cancers; thus, individualized consideration of risks versus benefits of endocrine therapy and additional adjuvant therapies should be incorporated into decision-making.
See Principles of Biomarker Testing (BINV-A).
sss Routine surgical resection of the primary breast tumor is generally not indicated in the management of patients presenting with de novo stage IV (M1) disease.
Although there is no survival benefit, it may be considered for local control of the primary tumor. Discussion regarding management of the primary tumor in this setting
must be individualized.
ttt Denosumab, zoledronic acid, or pamidronate (all with calcium and vitamin D supplementation) should be given (category 1) in addition to systemic therapy or
endocrine therapy if bone metastasis is present, expected survival is ≥3 months, and renal function is adequate. Patients should undergo a dental examination with
preventive dentistry prior to initiation of this therapy. The optimal schedule for zoledronic acid is every 12 weeks.

AXILLARY LYMPH NODE STAGING
This section is considered informational and has not been resource stratified.
The use of interventions outlined in this section should be based on resource availability and best clinical judgment.
SLNB should be performed and is the preferred method of axillary lymph node staging if the patient is an appropriate SLNB candidate
(BINV-D).
In the absence of definitive data demonstrating superior survival, the performance of axillary staging may be considered optional in patients
who have particularly favorable tumors, patients for whom the selection of adjuvant systemic and/or RT is unlikely to be affected, those ≥70
years of age, or those with serious comorbid conditions.a
Level III dissection to the thoracic inlet should be performed only in cases with gross disease in level II and/or lll.
In the absence of gross disease in level II nodes, lymph node dissection should include tissue inferior to the axillary vein from the latissimus
dorsi muscle laterally to the medial border of the pectoralis minor muscle (level I/II).
Lymphedema is a potential side effect after the treatment of axillary lymph node surgery resulting from damage to the lymphatic system.
Early detection/diagnosis of lymphedema is key for optimal management. Consider pretreatment measurement of both arms as a baseline for
patients with risk factors for lymphedema. See NCCN Guidelines for Survivorship: Lymphedema (SLYMPH-1).
a Sentinel node biopsy may be omitted based on the SSO Choosing Wisely recommendation in patients ≥70 years of age with HR+/HER2-negative and pT1, cN0 tumors.

MARGIN STATUS RECOMMENDATIONS AFTER BREAST-CONSERVING SURGERY (BCS) FOR INVASIVE CANCERS AND DCIS
This section is considered informational and has not been resource stratified.
The use of interventions outlined in this section should be based on resource availability and best clinical judgment.
• Margins should be evaluated on all surgical specimens from BCS. Requirements for optimal margin evaluation include:
Orientation of the surgical specimens
Description of the gross and microscopic margin status
Reporting of the distance, orientation, and type of tumor (invasive or DCIS) in relation to the closest margin.
• For mammographically detected DCIS with microcalcifications, complete resection should be documented by analysis of margins and
specimen radiography. Post-excision mammography can be considered if there is uncertainty.
• The NCCN Panel accepts the definitions of negative margins after breast-conservation therapy from the 2014 SSO/ASTRO Margins
Guideline1 for Stage I/II Invasive Cancers and the 2016 SSO/ASTRO/ASCO Guideline for DCIS.2 For patients with stage I or II invasive cancers
after BCS, a positive margin is defined as “ink on tumor” (any invasive cancer or DCIS cells on ink). These patients generally require further
surgery—either a re-excision to achieve a negative margin or a mastectomy. If re-excision is technically feasible to allow for BCS to achieve
“no ink on tumor,” this can be done with resection of the involved margin guided by the orientation of the initial resection specimen or re-
excision of the entire original excision cavity. There may be select patients with stage III invasive cancers who may be eligible for BCS. For
these patients, the margins status would be accessed with similar definitions.
DCIS
• For patients with pure DCIS treated by BCS and WBRT, a quantitative description of any tumor close to margin resection width of at least
2 mm is associated with a reduced risk of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) relative to narrower negative margin widths, while
the routine practice of obtaining margins greater than 2 mm to further improve outcomes is not supported by the evidence. When there is
only minimal or focal DCIS involvement near the margin, clinical judgment should be utilized to weigh the risks of re-excision with risk of
recurrence for an individual patient.
• For patients with DCIS treated with excision alone (no WBRT), regardless of margin width, there is a substantially higher rate of IBTR than
treatment with excision and WBRT, even in predefined, patients who are low risk. Although the optimal margin width for treatment with
excision alone is unknown, it should be at least 2 mm, with some evidence suggesting improved IBTR rates with margin widths wider than 2
mm.
• DCIS with microinvasion (DCIS-M), defined as an invasive focus ≤1 mm in size, should refer to the DCIS margin definition when considering
the optimal margin width (>2 mm), given that the majority of DCIS-M is comprised of DCIS and systemic therapy utilization for this lesion
more closely reflects the treatment pattern for DCIS than for invasive carcinoma.

MARGIN STATUS RECOMMENDATIONS AFTER BCS FOR INVASIVE CANCERS AND DCIS
This section is considered informational and has not been resource stratified.
The use of interventions outlined in this section should be based on resource availability and best clinical judgment.
Invasive Breast Cancer
• For invasive breast cancers that have a component of DCIS, regardless of the extent of DCIS, the negative margin definition of “no ink on
tumor” should be based on the invasive margin guideline. In this setting, “no ink on tumor” is recommended for either DCIS or invasive
cancer cells, primarily because the natural history, treatment, and outcomes of these lesions are more similar to invasive cancer than DCIS.
For specifically challenging cases, clinical judgment and discussion with the patient should precede routine re-excision.
• These margin recommendations cannot be applied directly to patients undergoing APBI/PBI,1 where data regarding local recurrence are
more limited. Furthermore, individualized clinical judgment should be utilized on a case-by-case basis, using postoperative mammography
to identify residual calcifications and clinical-pathologic factors such as quantitative extent of disease near margin, presence of extensive
intraductal component (EIC),3 young age, or multiple close margins to assist in identifying patients who may have an increased risk of IBTR
and therefore may be selected to benefit from re-excision.
• For patients with invasive breast cancer after BCS, with microscopically focally positive margins (in the absence of an EIC),3 the use of a
higher radiation boost dose to the tumor bed may be considered, since generally a boost to the tumor bed is recommended for patients at
higher risk of recurrence. See BINV-I.

PRINCIPLES OF BREAST RECONSTRUCTION FOLLOWING SURGERY
This section is considered informational and has not been resource stratified.
The use of interventions outlined in this section should be based on resource availability and best clinical judgment.
General Principles of Breast Reconstruction
• Breast reconstruction may be an option for any patient receiving surgical treatment for breast cancer. All patients undergoing breast
cancer treatment should be educated about breast reconstructive options as adapted to their individual clinical situation. However,
breast reconstruction should not interfere with the appropriate surgical, medical, and radiation management of the cancer or the scope of
appropriate surgical treatment for this disease. Coordinating consultation and surgical treatment with a reconstructive surgeon should be
executed within a reasonable time frame. The process of breast reconstruction should not govern the timing or the scope of appropriate
surgical treatment for this disease. The availability of or the practicality of breast reconstruction should not result in the delay or refusal of
appropriate surgical, medical, and radiation intervention.
• Some patients may choose not to have reconstruction after mastectomy. The option to undergo mastectomy alone with a surgically
optimized closure should be offered to all patients as part of a comprehensive discussion of reconstructive options. Achieving the optimal
result in this scenario may require additional procedures beyond the initial mastectomy. See BINV-H (6) for patient factors influencing choice
of reconstruction.
• Selection of reconstruction option is based on an assessment of cancer treatment, body habits of patients, obesity, smoking history,
comorbidities, and patient concerns. Smoking and obesity (WHO Class 2 and 3) increase the risk of perioperative complications for all types
of breast reconstruction. Patients with these high risk factors should be counseled about their increased risk for complications following
breast reconstruction, including donor site complications/hernias and bulges of the abdominal wall, delayed healing, mastectomy skin flap
necrosis, total flap failure (obesity), and implant failure (smoking).
• Nipple areolar reconstruction should be offered to patients if the nipple-areolar complex (NAC) has been removed as part of their cancer
treatment. Various techniques are available for nipple reconstruction. Three-dimensional (3-D) tattooing can be offered to patients as an
option for NAC reconstruction.
• Additionally, patients who are not satisfied with the cosmetic outcome following completion of breast cancer treatment should be offered
reconstructive surgery consultation.
• Patients known to harbor genetic mutations that increase the risk of breast cancer may opt to undergo bilateral prophylactic mastectomies
with reconstruction. Reconstruction can be performed with prosthetic, autologous tissue, or a combination of implant with autologous
tissue.
• Skin-sparing mastectomy should be performed by an experienced breast surgery team that works in a coordinated, multidisciplinary fashion
to guide proper patient selection for skin-sparing mastectomy, determine optimal sequencing of the reconstructive procedure(s) in relation
to adjuvant therapies, and perform a resection that achieves appropriate surgical margins.
• Revisional surgery may be necessary after breast reconstruction. This may include procedures such as fat grafting, mastopexy, direct
excision/suction-assisted lipectomy, contralateral procedures (in cases of unilateral reconstruction), and others. Patients should be informed
before reconstruction that revision surgery may be necessary.

Patient Factors Influencing Breast Reconstruction
• Breast reconstruction is elective and patients may choose to not have breast reconstruction. Individual patients present preoperatively with
a variety of factors that may impact the choice of reconstruction, the risk of complications, donor site morbidity, and aesthetic result. Each
of these factors must be taken into account, along with patient desire, to choose the optimal method of reconstruction.
• Patient desire
The patient may have a strong feeling towards one form of reconstruction after being given the options. Breast reconstruction should be a
shared decision.
• Medical comorbidities
Medical comorbidities may preclude longer reconstructive procedures such as autologous tissue reconstruction in some patients.
The selection of the reconstructive method of choice should take into consideration patient comorbidities.
Poorly controlled diabetes is a risk factor for postoperative complications in both implant and autologous tissue reconstruction.
Patients should be screened for personal or familial thrombophilia. Thrombophilia may result in reconstructive failure of microsurgical
reconstruction or thromboembolic events.
• Tobacco use
Smoking has been associated with increased risk of delayed wound healing, mastectomy flap necrosis, NAC necrosis in the setting of
nipple-sparing mastectomy, infection, and failure of implant-based reconstruction. In free flap reconstruction, smoking increases the risk
of donor complications. Patients should be encouraged to stop smoking prior to reconstruction.
Smoking has not definitively been shown to increase the risk of microvascular thrombosis in free flap breast reconstruction.
• Breast size/shape
If patient has significant macromastia or ptosis, consideration can be given to a reduction pattern mastectomy with either implant-based or
autologous tissue reconstruction, or oncoplastic reduction techniques.
The volume limitations of implants may preclude an acceptable reconstruction in patients with macromastia if preservation of volume is a
priority.
• BMI
Patients with a markedly elevated BMI may be at increased risk of infectious complications and seromas as well as donor site
complications from autologous reconstruction, including delayed healing and hernia formation. Immediate reconstruction can be
performed, but delayed reconstruction can be considered if the patient is motivated to lose weight. Oncoplastic reduction techniques can
be considered if the breast is large/ptotic.
• Breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL)
There exists an association between certain types of textured breast implants and BIA-ALCL. The risk appears to vary based on the
method of texturing. Patients with a past or current history of textured implants should follow up with their reconstructive surgeon.

PRINCIPLES OF BREAST RECONSTRUCTION FOLLOWING SURGERY
This section is considered informational and has not been resource stratified.
The use of interventions outlined in this section should be based on resource availability and best clinical judgment.
Special Cases
• Nipple-sparing mastectomy
NAC-sparing procedures may be an option in patients with cancer who are carefully selected by experienced multidisciplinary teams.
Retrospective data support the use of NAC-sparing procedures for early-stage breast cancer, DCIS, risk-reduction procedures, and in
some locally advanced invasive cancers (ie, with complete clinical response to preoperative chemotherapy and no nipple involvement with
cancer).
Contraindications to NAC include: Preoperative clinical or radiographic evidence of nipple involvement, including Paget disease, bloody
nipple discharge associated with malignancy, IBC, and/or imaging findings suggesting malignant involvement of the nipple or subareolar
tissues.
Nipple margin assessment is mandatory and should be clearly designated on the specimen.
Preoperative breast size, shape, and nipple position should also be considered in the decision to perform NAC-sparing mastectomy.
Patients with small to moderate breast volume with good nipple position are ideal candidates. In patients with large or significantly ptotic
breasts, NAC-sparing mastectomies may be offered in select cases by using various reduction patterns or delay techniques to augment
the NAC perfusion, either in an immediate or delayed fashion, as long as it does not delay oncologic care. Intraoperative assessment of the
NAC perfusion should also guide the decision to preserve the NAC or remove it.
Patients should be counseled on the risk of delayed healing, nipple necrosis, loss of pigmentation, loss of sensation, loss of projection,
and need for subsequent removal of the NAC.
Topical 2% nitroglycerine (45 mg total dose) used prophylactically has been shown to reduce mastectomy skin flap necrosis in both skin-
sparing mastectomy and nipple sparing mastectomy in one randomized control trial.
• Inflammatory breast cancer
Delayed reconstruction after mastectomy for IBC remains the clinical standard, for several reasons. The need to resect involved skin
negates the benefit of skin-sparing mastectomy for immediate reconstruction, and high rates of local and distant recurrence warrant
comprehensive, RNI in a timely fashion, which may be technically more challenging or subject to delay after immediate reconstruction.
Advances in multimodal therapy have improved 5-year survival in patients with IBC, justifying clinical studies to see if immediate
reconstruction may be appropriate for certain patients with IBC, but neither the outcomes nor the clinical features to predict such
outcomes are known at this time.
In the uncommon clinical circumstance that the extent of skin excision at the time of mastectomy precludes primary or local closure,
reconstruction of the chest wall defect with autologous tissue is necessary, and concomitant immediate reconstruction may be
accomplished.

PRINCIPLES OF RADIATION THERAPY
This section is considered informational and has not been resource stratified.
The use of interventions outlined in this section should be based on resource availability and best clinical judgment.
Optimizing Delivery of Individual Therapy
• It is important to individualize RT planning and delivery.
3-D CT-based treatment planning should routinely be utilized to delineate target volumes & organs at risk, and assess dose distribution
across the entire treatment volume.
Radiation to the breast/chest wall and nodal regions is generally delivered with single energy or mixed energy photons ± electrons.
Treatment planning should be optimized to maximally improve homogeneity across the target volume while minimizing dose to organs at
risk.
Additional techniques such as respiratory control (deep inspiration breath-hold), prone positioning, and cardiac blocks may also be used
to try to further reduce dose to heart, lung, and adjacent normal tissue.
At a minimum, weekly imaging to verify treatment setup should be utilized. More frequent imaging may be needed for selected cases with
inconsistent reproducibility. Image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) may be utilized with deep inspiration breath-hold (DIBH) technique to
reduce normal tissue exposure of the heart, lung or liver.
Dose-volume histograms (DVHs) should be used to evaluate, dose and constraints to normal tissues (ie, heart, lung), and planning target
volumes (PTVs).
• It is common for RT to follow chemotherapy when chemotherapy is indicated.
Whole Breast Radiation
• Target definition is the breast tissue at risk.
• RT dosing:
The whole breast should receive a hypofractionated dose of 40–42.5 Gy in 15–16 fractions; in selected cases 45–50.4 Gy in 25–28 fractions
may be considered.
A boost to the tumor bed is recommended in patients at higher risk for recurrence. Typical boost doses are 10–16 Gy in 4–8 fractions.
Ultra-hypofractionated WBRT of 28.5 Gy in 5 (once-a-week) fractions may be considered for selected pts over 50 years following BCS with
early-stage, node-negative disease, particularly those in whom a boost is not intended.a,b
• Lumpectomy cavity boost can be delivered using enface electrons, photons, or brachytherapy.
a Alternatively, 26 Gy in 5 daily fractions over one week may be considered, though data beyond 5 years for local relapse or toxicity are not yet available for this
regimen. [Murray Brunt A, Haviland JS, Wheatley DA, et al. Hypofractionated breast radiotherapy for 1 week versus 3 weeks (FAST-Forward): 5-year efficacy and late

PRINCIPLES OF RADIATION THERAPY
This section is considered informational and has not been resource stratified.
The use of interventions outlined in this section should be based on resource availability and best clinical judgment.
Post-mastectomy Radiation (including breast reconstruction)
• The target includes the ipsilateral chest wall and the entire mastectomy scar ± drain sites.
Regional nodal RT is typically delivered with the chest wall. See below.
• In the case of cT3N0, high-risk features for considering PMRT include, but are not limited to, young age and/or LVI.
• Based on anatomic considerations and presence of reconstruction, various 3-D-, IMRT, or VMAT techniques using photons and/or electrons are appropriate.
• PMRT details and dosing:
The routine use of bolus is not recommended. Bolus should be considered in the use of IBC or clinical-pathologic situations where the dose to the skin
may not be adequate.
Chest wall scar boost of 10-16 Gy/fx at 1.8 to 2.0 Gy/fx total 5-8 fractions may be delivered with or without bolus using electrons or photons.
Chest wall RT dose is 45-50.4 Gy at 1.8-2 Gy/fx in 25-28 fractions. Patients not undergoing breast reconstruction may alternatively receive 40 Gy at 2.67
Gy/fx or 42.5 Gy at 2.66 Gy/fx
Regional Nodal Radiation
• For supra/infra-clavicular and axillary nodes, prescription depth varies based on the patient anatomy.
c,d
• Regional nodes should be contoured when considering regional nodal RT. Refer to breast atlases for contouring guidelines.
• RT dosing:
Regional node dose is 45–50.4 Gy at 1.8–2 Gy/fx; patients not undergoing breast reconstruction may alternatively receive 40 Gy at 2.67 Gy/fx or 42.5 Gy at
2.66 Gy/fx
A supplemental boost of RT can be delivered to grossly involved or enlarged lymph nodes (ie, internal mammary, supra/infra-clavicular) that have not
been surgically removed.
RT with Preoperative or Adjuvant Systemic Therapy
• In patients treated with preoperative systemic therapy, adjuvant RT is based on the maximal disease stage (ie, clinical stage, pathologic stage, tumor
characteristics) at diagnosis (before preoperative systemic therapy) and pathology results after preoperative systemic therapy.
• Sequencing of RT with systemic therapy:
It is common for RT to follow chemotherapy when chemotherapy is indicated. However,
– CMF (cyclophosphamide/methotrexate/fluorouracil) is the only standard regimen that can be given concurrently with RT.
– Capecitabine is typically given after completion of RT.
– Olaparib should be given after completion of RT.
Available data suggest that sequential or concurrent endocrine therapy with RT is acceptable. Due to compounding side effects, initiating endocrine
therapy at the completion of RT may be preferred.
◊ Abemaciclib should be initiated after completion of surgery/RT/chemotherapy, concurrently with endocrine therapy.
Adjuvant HER2-targeted therapy ± endocrine therapy may be delivered concurrently with RT.

Accelerated Partial Breast Irradiation (APBI)/Partial Breast Irradiation (PBI)
• APBI/PBI offers comparable local control to WBRT in selected patients with low-risk early-stage breast cancer. However, the optimal
external beam-APBI/PBI technique/fractionation for minimizing long-term cosmesis effects has not been determined.
Patients are encouraged to participate in clinical trials.
The NCCN Panel recommends APBI/PBI for any patient with no BRCA 1/2 mutations meeting the criteria outlined in the 2016 ASTRO
consensus statement for guidance on APBI/PBI use.
According to the 2016 ASTRO criteria, patients aged ≥50 years are "suitable" for APBI/PBI if they have:
◊ Invasive ductal carcinoma measuring ≤2 cm (pT1 disease) with negative margin widths of ≥2 mm, no LVI, and ER-positive tumors
or
◊ Low/intermediate nuclear grade, screening-detected DCIS measuring size ≤2.5 cm with negative margin widths of ≥3 mm.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR BREAST CANCER IN MALES (SEX ASSIGNED AT BIRTH)
This section is considered informational and has not been resource stratified.
The use of interventions outlined in this section should be based on resource availability and best clinical judgment.
NCCN recommendations have been developed to be inclusive of individuals of all sexual and gender identities to the greatest extent
possible. On this page, the terms males and females refer to sex assigned at birth.
• Few males have been included in breast cancer trials.1 Therefore, recommendations regarding management of breast cancer in males are
generally extrapolated from findings of clinical trials focusing on breast cancer in females.
• Although there are some biologic and clinical differences between breast cancer in males and females, management of breast cancer in
males is similar overall to management of breast cancer in females, with the following special considerations pertinent to male patients2:
Genetics: The NCCN Panel recommends consideration of genetic testing for all males with breast cancer (See NCCN Guidelines for
Genetic/Familial High-Risk Assessment: Breast, Ovarian, and Pancreatic).
Breast surgery: Historically, males with breast cancer have undergone mastectomy more often than BCS. However, breast-conservation
therapy is increasingly being performed in males and evolving data indicate that breast conservation in males is associated with
equivalent outcomes to mastectomy and that it is safe and feasible. Decisions about breast conservation versus mastectomy in males
should be made according to similar criteria as for females.2-9
Axillary lymph node surgery: As in females, SLNB should be performed in the setting of male breast cancer with a clinically node-negative
axilla.2,4
RT: Indications for radiation after breast surgery in males with breast cancer are the same as for females with breast cancer.2,5,10,11
Use of molecular assays: Data are limited regarding the use of molecular assays to assess prognosis and to predict benefit from
chemotherapy in males with breast cancer.2 Available data suggest the 21-gene assay recurrence score provides prognostic information
in males with breast cancer.12,13
Preoperative/adjuvant systemic therapy: Chemotherapy with/without HER2-targeted therapy should be recommended for males with
breast cancer according to guidelines for females with breast cancer.2 Options for adjuvant endocrine therapy for males with breast
cancer include tamoxifen for 5–10 years or, if tamoxifen is contraindicated, a GnRH analog plus an aromatase inhibitor. In males, single-
agent adjuvant treatment with an aromatase inhibitor has been associated with inferior outcomes compared to tamoxifen alone, likely due
to inadequate estradiol suppression, and is not recommended.2,14-17
Follow-up after treatment for early-stage disease: There are only limited data to support screening for breast cancer in males.2 The NCCN
Panel recommends that bone density be assessed at baseline and every 2 years in males with breast cancer who receive adjuvant GnRH
analog therapy. Low bone density should be managed according to standard guidelines.18
Systemic therapy for advanced disease: Management of advanced breast cancer in males is similar to that in females; however, it is
preferred that when an aromatase inhibitor is used, a GnRH analog should be given concurrently.2 Available data suggest single-agent
fulvestrant has similar efficacy in males as in females.19 Newer agents such as CDK4/6 inhibitors in combination with an aromatase
inhibitor or fulvestrant, mTOR inhibitors, and PIK3CA inhibitors have not been systematically evaluated in clinical trials in males with
breast cancer. However, available real-world data suggest comparable efficacy and safety profiles and it is reasonable to recommend
these agents to males based on extrapolation of data from studies comprised largely of female participants with advanced breast cancer.
Indications for and recommendations regarding chemotherapy, HER2-targeted therapy, immunotherapy, and PARP inhibitors for advanced
breast cancer in males are similar to those for advanced breast cancer in females.1

• High-riske TNBC: Preoperative pembrolizumab (if available) + carboplatin + paclitaxel, followed by preoperative pembrolizumab (if available)
+ cyclophosphamide + doxorubicin or epirubicin, followed by adjuvant pembrolizumab (if available)
• TNBC and residual disease after preoperative therapy with taxane-, alkylator-, and anthracycline-based chemotherapyd: Capecitabine
Useful in Certain Circumstances: Other Recommended Regimens:
• Dose-dense AC (doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide) • AC followed by docetaxel every 3 weeksb
• AC (doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide) every 3 weeks (category 2B) • EC (epirubicin/cyclophosphamide)
• CMF (cyclophosphamide/methotrexate/fluorouracil) • TAC (docetaxel/doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide)

Additional Considerations for Those Receiving Preoperative/Adjuvant Therapy (BINV-L, 3)
a Alternative taxanes (ie, docetaxel, paclitaxel, albumin-bound paclitaxel) may be substituted for select patients due to medical necessity (ie, hypersensitivity reaction). If
substituted for weekly paclitaxel or docetaxel, then the weekly dose of albumin-bound paclitaxel should not exceed 125 mg/m2.
b It is acceptable to change the administration sequence to taxane (with or without HER2-targeted therapy) followed by AC.
c C onsider addition of adjuvant olaparib for 1 y for those with germline BRCA1/2 mutations and:
• TNBC, if 1) ≥pT2 or ≥pN1 disease after adjuvant chemotherapy, or 2) residual disease after preoperative chemotherapy
• HR-positive, HER2-negative tumors, if 1) ≥4 positive lymph nodes after adjuvant chemotherapy (category 2A), or 2) residual disease after preoperative therapy and
a clinical stage, pathologic stage, ER status, and tumor grade (CPS+EG) score ≥3.
Adjuvant olaparib can be used concurrently with endocrine therapy.
d Patients in the OlympiA trial did not receive capecitabine; thus, there are no data on sequencing or to guide selection of one agent over the other.
e High-risk criteria include stage II–III TNBC. The use of adjuvant pembrolizumab (if available) (category 2A) may be individualized.

PREOPERATIVE/ADJUVANT THERAPY REGIMENS
Additional Considerations for Those Receiving Preoperative/Adjuvant Therapy
• Consider scalp cooling to reduce incidence of chemotherapy-induced alopecia for patients receiving neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy.
Results may be less effective with anthracycline-containing regimens.
• Sequence of therapies in the adjuvant setting:
Chemotherapy and endocrine therapy should be given sequentially, with endocrine therapy given after chemotherapy.
Adjuvant olaparib can be given concurrently with endocrine therapy.
For sequencing of RT with systemic therapy, see BINV-I (2).
• Considerations for HER2-positive disease:
An FDA-approved biosimilar A biosimilar validated with the reference biologic product is an appropriate substitute for trastuzumab.
Trastuzumab and hyaluronidase-oysk injection for subcutaneous use may be substituted for trastuzumab. It has different dosage and
administration instructions compared to intravenous trastuzumab. Do not substitute trastuzumab and hyaluronidase-oysk for or with ado-
trastuzumab emtansine.
Pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and hyaluronidase-zzxf injection for subcutaneous use may be substituted anywhere that the combination of
intravenous pertuzumab and intravenous trastuzumab are given as part of systemic therapy. Pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and
hyaluronidase-zzxf injection for subcutaneous use has different dosing and administration instructions compared to the intravenous
products.

The selection, dosing, and administration of anti-cancer agents and the management of associated toxicities are complex. Modifications of drug dose and schedule and initiation of
supportive care interventions are often necessary because of expected toxicities and individual patient variability, prior treatment, and comorbidity. The optimal delivery of anti-cancer
agents therefore requires a health care delivery team experienced in the use of anti-cancer agents and the management of associated toxicities in patients with cancer.

PRINCIPLES OF PREOPERATIVE SYSTEMIC THERAPY
This section is considered informational and has not been resource stratified.
The use of interventions outlined in this section should be based on resource availability and best clinical judgment.
Known Benefits of Preoperative Systemic Therapy Cautions
• Facilitates breast conservation • Possible overtreatment with systemic therapy if clinical stage is
• Can render inoperable tumors operable overestimated
• Treatment response provides important prognostic information at an • Possible undertreatment locoregionally with radiotherapy if
individual patient level, particularly in patients with TNBC or HER2- clinical stage is underestimated
positive breast cancer • Possibility of disease progression during preoperative systemic
• Identifies patients with residual disease at higher risk for relapse to therapy
allow for the addition of supplemental adjuvant regimens, particularly
in patients with TNBC or HER2-positive breast cancer. Candidates for Preoperative Systemic Therapy
• Allows time for genetic testing • Patients with inoperable breast cancer:
• Allows time to plan breast reconstruction in patients electing IBC
mastectomy Bulky or matted cN2 axillary nodes
• Allows time for delayed decision-making for definitive surgery cN3 nodal disease
cT4 tumors
Opportunities • In select patients with operable breast cancer
• May allow SLNB alone if initial cN+ becomes cN0 after preoperative Preoperative systemic therapy is preferred for:
therapy ◊ HER2-positive disease and TNBC, if ≥cT2 or ≥cN1
• May provide an opportunity to modify systemic treatment if no ◊ Large primary tumor relative to breast size in a patient who
preoperative therapy response or progression of disease desires breast conservation
• May allow for more limited radiation fields in patients with cN+ who ◊ cN+ disease likely to become cN0 with preoperative systemic

• Provides excellent research platform to test novel therapies and Preoperative systemic therapy can be considered for cT1c, cN0
predictive biomarkers HER2-positive disease and TNBC
• Patients in whom definitive surgery may be delayed.
Non-candidates for Preoperative Systemic Therapy
• Patients with extensive in situ disease when extent of invasive
carcinoma is not well-defined
• Patients with a poorly delineated extent of tumor
• Patients whose tumors are not palpable or clinically assessable

sampling and reporting elements of the Residual Cancer Burden (RCB) (category 2B).a
• Randomized trials of chemotherapy demonstrate similar long-term outcomes when patients are given the same treatment preoperatively
compared with postoperatively.b
• Pathologic complete response (pCR) to preoperative systemic therapy is associated with an extremely favorable disease-free and overall
survival (OS), particularly in situations in which all treatment is given preoperatively. The correlation between pathologic response and long-
term outcome is strongest for TNBC, somewhat less so for HER2-positive disease, and least for ER-positive disease.c,d
• A number of chemotherapy regimens have activity in the preoperative setting. In general, those chemotherapy regimens recommended in
the adjuvant setting may be considered in the preoperative setting. See Preoperative/Adjuvant Therapy Regimens (BINV-L).
• Preoperative endocrine therapy alone may be considered for patients with ER-positive disease based on comorbidities or low-risk luminal
biology based on clinical characteristics and/or genomic signatures (until desired effect is achieved). Data shows that optimal duration for
response if achieved between 4–6 months.e
• Patients with HER-2 positive, ≥cT2 and/or cN+ should be considered for HER2-directed therapy preoperatively.f See Preoperative/Adjuvant
Therapy Regimens (BINV-L).
• Some studies suggest an increased risk of locoregional recurrence following use of preoperative chemotherapy.g These trials delivered
chemotherapy regimens that are no longer standard, did not include targeted therapies, did not use modern imaging techniques, and/or
used non-standard locoregional management. Care should be taken to follow the procedures outlined in BINV-12 and BINV-14 to assure
appropriate locoregional management. Not all patients are appropriate candidates for preoperative systemic therapy. Accurate clinical
staging at baseline prior to initiation of preoperative systemic therapy is critical. See Potentially Operable Disease: Breast and Axillary
Evaluation Prior to Preoperative Systemic Therapy (BINV-12).
• Tumor response should be routinely assessed by clinical exam and imaging studies (see footnote uu on BINV-13) during delivery of
preoperative therapy. It is preferred that the standard regimen is completed prior to surgery. If all intended treatment is not completed prior
to surgery, the remainder may be given in the adjuvant setting. Patients with operable breast cancer experiencing progression of disease
during preoperative systemic therapy may be given an alternate systemic regimen or proceed to surgery if deemed resectable. Locoregional
therapy principles should be applied in the same manner as in patients treated with adjuvant systemic therapy.

DEFINITION OF MENOPAUSE
This section is considered informational and has not been resource stratified.
The use of interventions outlined in this section should be based on resource availability and best clinical judgment.
• Menopause is the permanent cessation of menses and includes a profound and permanent decrease in ovarian estrogen synthesis.
• Determination of menopausal status may be required to guide selection of endocrine therapy for breast cancer.
• Menopause is usually a clinical diagnosis made after ≥12 months of amenorrhea. Natural menopause is experienced between ages 42–58
years.
• Breast cancer treatments may affect ovarian function and menses.
In those who are premenopausal at the beginning of chemotherapy and who develop chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea, ovarian function
may still be intact despite amenorrhea or may resume over time. The likelihood of ovarian function resuming after chemotherapy is higher
among those aged <40 years.
Tamoxifen may cause amenorrhea without inducing menopause in premenopausal individuals.
Ovarian function suppression induces amenorrhea and reduces ovarian estrogen synthesis without causing permanent menopause.
• Twelve months of amenorrhea alone is insufficient to diagnose menopause with chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea or with tamoxifen
± ovarian suppression. FSH and estradiol levels are used to support the diagnosis of menopause; however, clear criteria to guide
interpretation of FSH and estradiol in this population is lacking.
Tamoxifen may alter FSH levels, limiting its utility in determination of menopausal status.
FSH and estradiol should be repeated serially to ensure menopausal status in patients with breast cancer with chemotherapy-induced
amenorrhea.
• Evidence-based criteria for the diagnosis of menopause in patients with breast cancer are lacking. Clinical trials in breast cancer have
utilized a variety of definitions of menopause. Reasonable criteria for determining menopause in patients with breast cancer include any of
the following:
Prior bilateral oophorectomy
Age ≥60 years
Age <60 with amenorrhea for ≥12 months in the absence of prior chemotherapy, receipt of tamoxifen, toremifene, or ovarian suppression
and estradiol and FSH in the post-menopausal range
Age <60 years: chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea for ≥12 months with FSH and estradiol in post-menopausal range on serial
assessments
Age <60 years: on tamoxifen with FSH and estradiol level in post-menopausal range
• Menopausal status cannot be determined in those receiving ovarian function suppression
Note: This is the NCCN Framework for Resource Stratification of NCCN Guidelines. For definitions of the NCCN Framework™, see page FR-1.

Targeted Therapy Options BINV-Q (6)
j Considerations for those receiving systemic HER2-targeted therapy (BINV-Q 4).
k Assess for germline BRCA1/2 mutations in all patients with recurrent or metastatic breast cancer to identify candidates for PARP inhibitor therapy. While olaparib and talazoparib are FDA-
indicated in HER2-negative disease, the panel supports use in any breast cancer subtype associated with a germline mutation. There is lower-level evidence for HER2-positive tumors,
therefore category 2A for this setting.
l Maintenance trastuzumab/pertuzumab after response (with concurrent endocrine therapy if ER+ and HER2+ metastatic breast cancer).
m Fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki may be considered in the first-line setting as an option for select patients (ie, those with rapid progression within 6 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant
therapy [12 months for pertuzumab-containing regimens]). Fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki is associated with interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis. Regular monitoring for this
serious side effect is recommended. For patients with a history of ILD/pneumonitis, there are no data on managing safety or toxicity of this drug in a trial.
n Tucatinib + trastuzumab + capecitabine is preferred in patients with both systemic and CNS progression in the third-line setting and beyond; and it may be given in the second-line setting.
o May be used as an option for third-line and beyond; the optimal sequence for third-line therapy and beyond is not known. If not a candidate fam-trastuzumab T-DM1 could be considered in
the second-line.
p Multiple lines of concurrent chemotherapy with anti-HER2 therapy (trastuzumab or a TKI) offer clinical benefit for recurrent unresectable HER2+ metastatic breast cancer and have been
studied in phase 2 or 3 trials. Clinical experience suggests frequent clinical benefit for such treatment. However, there are no meaningful data for use of any of these regimens among
patients previously treated with pertuzumab-based chemotherapy, ado-trastuzumab emtansine, fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki, or trastuzumab/capecitabine/tucatinib regimens. Thus,
the optimal sequence or true benefit of therapy is not known.
q Trastuzumab given in combination with an anthracycline is associated with significant cardiac toxicity. Concurrent use of trastuzumab and pertuzumab with an anthracycline should be
avoided.
r Trastuzumab may be safely combined with all non-anthracycline–containing preferred and other single agents listed on (BINV-Q 5) for recurrent or metastatic breast cancer.

Additional Considerations for Those Receiving Systemic Therapy for HER2-Positive Disease
• When receiving taxane-containing regimen:
Alternative taxanes (ie, docetaxel, paclitaxel, albumin-bound paclitaxel) may be substituted for select patients due to medical
necessity (ie, hypersensitivity reaction). If substituted for weekly paclitaxel or docetaxel, then the weekly dose of albumin-bound
paclitaxel should not exceed 125 mg/m2.
Consider cryotherapy of hands and feet to decrease the risk of peripheral neuropathy.1,2
• An FDA-approved biosimilar A biosimilar validated with the reference biologic product is an appropriate substitute for trastuzumab.
• Trastuzumab and hyaluronidase-oysk injection for subcutaneous use may be substituted for trastuzumab. It has different dosage
and administration instructions compared to intravenous trastuzumab. Do not substitute trastuzumab and hyaluronidase-oysk for or
with ado-trastuzumab emtansine or fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki.
• Pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and hyaluronidase-zzxf injection for subcutaneous use may be substituted anywhere that the
combination of intravenous pertuzumab and intravenous trastuzumab are given as part of systemic therapy. Pertuzumab,
trastuzumab, and hyaluronidase-zzxf injection for subcutaneous use has different dosing and administration instructions compared
to the intravenous products.
• Patients previously treated with chemotherapy plus trastuzumab in the absence of pertuzumab in the metastatic setting may be
considered for one line of therapy including both trastuzumab plus pertuzumab in combination with or without cytotoxic therapy
(such as vinorelbine or taxane). Further research is needed to determine the ideal sequencing strategy for anti-HER2 therapy.

The selection, dosing, and administration of anti-cancer agents and the management of associated toxicities are complex. Modifications of drug dose
and schedule and initiation of supportive care interventions are often necessary because of expected toxicities and individual patient variability, prior References on
treatment, and comorbidity. The optimal delivery of anti-cancer agents therefore requires a health care delivery team experienced in the use of anti-

The selection, dosing, and administration of anti-cancer agents and the management of associated toxicities are complex. Modifications of drug dose and schedule and initiation of supportive care interventions
are often necessary because of expected toxicities and individual patient variability, prior treatment, and comorbidity. The optimal delivery of anti-cancer agents therefore requires a health care delivery team
experienced in the use of anti-cancer agents and the management of associated toxicities in patients with cancer.

PRINCIPLES OF MONITORING METASTATIC DISEASE
This section is considered informational and has not been resource stratified.
The use of interventions outlined in this section should be based on resource availability and best clinical judgment.
Monitoring of patient symptoms and cancer burden during treatment of metastatic breast cancer is important to determine whether the
treatment is providing benefit and that the patient does not have toxicity from an ineffective therapy.
Components of Monitoring
Monitoring includes periodic assessment of varied combinations of symptoms, physical examination, routine laboratory tests, imaging
studies, and blood biomarkers where appropriate. Results of monitoring are classified as response/continued response to treatment, stable
disease, uncertainty regarding disease status, or progression of disease. The clinician typically must assess and balance multiple different
forms of information to make a determination regarding whether disease is being controlled and the toxicity of treatment is acceptable.
Sometimes, this information may be contradictory. Clinicians should take into account patient preferences through a shared decision-making
process.
Definition of Disease Progression
Unequivocal evidence of progression of disease by one or more of these factors is required to establish progression of disease, either
because of ineffective therapy or acquired resistance of disease to an applied therapy. Progression of disease may be identified through
evidence of growth or worsening of disease at previously known sites of disease and/or of the occurrence of new sites of metastatic disease.
• Findings concerning for progression of disease include:
Worsening symptoms such as pain or dyspnea
Evidence of worsening or new disease on physical examination
Declining performance status
Unexplained weight loss
Increasing alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), or bilirubin
Hypercalcemia
New radiographic abnormality or increase in the size of pre-existing radiographic abnormality
New areas of abnormality on functional imaging (eg, bone scan, PET/CT)
Increasing tumor markers (eg, carcinoembryonic antigen [CEA], CA 15-3, CA 27.29)a
a Rising tumor markers (eg, CEA, CA 15-3, CA 27.29) are concerning for tumor progression, but may also be seen in the setting of responding disease. An isolated
increase in tumor markers should rarely be used to declare progression of disease. Changes in bone lesions are often difficult to assess on plain or cross-sectional
radiology or on bone scan. For these reasons, patient symptoms and serum tumor markers may be more helpful in patients with bone-dominant metastatic disease.

This section is considered informational and has not been resource stratified.
The use of interventions outlined in this section should be based on resource availability and best clinical judgment.
Use of Objective Criteria for Response/Stability/Progression
• The most accurate assessments of disease activity typically occur when previously abnormal studies are repeated on a serial and regular
basis. Generally, the same method of assessment should be used over time (eg, an abnormality found on chest CT should generally be
monitored with repeat chest CT).
• Some non-clinically important variation in measurement of abnormalities by all serial studies is common and expected. Therefore, the use
of objective and widely accepted criteria for response, stability, and progression of disease are encouraged. Such systems include the
Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelines (Eisenhauer EA, Therasse P, Bogaerts J, et al. New response evaluation
criteria in solid tumours: revised RECIST guideline [version 1.1]. Eur J Cancer 2009;45:228-247) and the WHO criteria (Miller AB, Hoogstraten
B, Staquet M, Winkler A. Reporting results of cancer treatment. Cancer 1981;47:207-214).
• Studies of functional imaging, such as radionuclide bone scans and PET imaging, are particularly challenging when used to assess
response. In the case of bone scans, responding disease may result in a flare or increased activity on the scan that may be misinterpreted
as disease progression, especially on the first follow-up bone scan after initiating a new therapy. PET imaging is challenging because of the
absence of a reproducible, validated, and widely accepted set of standards for disease activity assessment.

Frequency of Monitoring
The optimal frequency of repeat testing is uncertain, and is primarily based on the monitoring strategies utilized in breast cancer clinical
trials. The frequency of monitoring must balance the need to detect progressive disease, avoid unnecessary toxicity of any ineffective therapy,
resource utilization, and determine cost. The following table is to provide guidance, and should be modified for the individual patient based
on sites of disease, biology of disease, and treatment regimen. Reassessment of disease activity should be performed in patients with new or
worsening signs or symptoms of disease, regardless of the time interval from previous studies.

American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC)
TNM Staging System For Breast Cancer
Primary Tumor (T) The T category of the primary tumor is defined by the same criteria regardless of whether it is based on clinical or pathological criteria, or both. The
T category is based primarily on the size of the invasive component of the cancer. The maximum size of a tumor focus is used as an estimate of disease volume. The
largest contiguous dimension of a tumor focus is used, and small satellite foci of noncontiguous tumor are not added to the size. The cellular fibrous reaction to invasive
tumor cells is generally included in the measurement of a tumor prior to treatment; however, the dense fibrosis observed following neoadjuvant treatment is generally
not included in the pathological measurement because its extent may overestimate the residual tumor volume. The clinical size of a primary tumor (T) can be measured
based on clinical findings (physical examination and imaging modalities, such as mammography, ultrasound, and MR imaging) and pathological findings (gross and
microscopic measurements). Clinical tumor size (cT) should be based on the clinical findings that are judged to be most accurate for a particular case, although it may
still be somewhat inaccurate because the intent of some breast cancers is not always apparent with current imaging techniques and because tumors are composed of
varying proportions of noninvasive and invasive disease, which these techniques are currently unable to distinguish. Size should be measured to the nearest millimeter.
If the tumor size is slightly less than or greater than a cutoff for a given T classification the size should be rounded to the millimeter reading that is closest to the cutoff.
For example, a reported size of 4.9 mm is reported as 5 mm, or a size of 2.04 cm is reported as 2.0 cm (20 mm). The exception to this rounding rule is for a breast
tumor sized between 1.0 and 1.4 mm. These sizes are rounded up to 2 mm, because rounding down would result in the cancer’s being categorized as microinvasive
carcinoma (T1mi) defined as a size of 1.0 mm or less.

T2 Tumor >20 mm but ≤50 mm in greatest dimension

Histologic Grade (G)
All invasive breast carcinomas should be assigned a histologic grade. The
Nottingham combined histologic grade (Nottingham modification of the SBR
grading system) is recommended and is stipulated for use by the College of
American Pathologists (see www.cap.org). The grade for a tumor is determined
by assessing morphologic features (tubule formation, nuclear pleomorphism, and
calibrated mitotic count), assigning a value from 1 (favorable) to 3 (unfavorable)
for each feature, and totaling the scores for all three categories. A combined score
of 3–5 points is designated as grade 1; a combined score of 6–7 points is grade 2;
a combined score of 8–9 points is grade 3. The use of subjective grading alone is
discouraged.

multi-disciplinary panel of representatives from NCCN member institutions
with breast cancer-focused expertise in the fields of medical oncology,
surgical oncology, radiation oncology, pathology, reconstructive surgery,
and patient advocacy.
Literature Search Criteria and Guidelines Update
Methodology
Prior to the update, an electronic search of the PubMed database was
performed to obtain key literature in Breast Cancer: Breast Cancer,
Breast Neoplasms, DCIS, Inflammatory Breast Cancer OR Phyllodes.
The PubMed database was chosen as it remains the most widely used
resource for medical literature and indexes peer-reviewed biomedical
literature.2
The search results were narrowed by selecting studies in humans
published in English. Results were confined to the following article types:
Clinical Trial, Phase III; Clinical Trial, Phase IV; Guideline; Randomized
Controlled Trial; Meta-Analysis; Systematic Reviews; and Validation
Studies.

Data from multiple studies of patients treated with endocrine therapy either
before, during, or after RT suggest no difference in outcomes or

concurrent endocrine therapy with RT is acceptable. However, due to
compounding side effects, initiating endocrine therapy at the completion of
RT may be preferred.
When adjuvant capecitabine214 is indicated, since it is a known
radiosensitizing agent with potential to increase toxicity to normal tissue, it
should be given after completion of adjuvant RT.
When adjuvant olaparib is used, the panel recommends that olaparib be

administered concurrently with RT and there are limited data on safety of

Adjuvant HER2-targeted therapy may be delivered concurrently with RT.

breast-conserving attempts are deemed impractical or unrealistic.
Nevertheless, the consensus of the panel is that these issues should be
considered prior to surgery for individuals who are likely to have a surgical
defect that is cosmetically unsatisfactory. Those who undergo
lumpectomy and are dissatisfied with the cosmetic outcome after
treatment should be offered a consultation with a plastic surgeon to
address the repair of resulting breast defects. Patients should be informed
of the possibility of positive margins and potential need for secondary
surgery, which could include re-excision segmental resection, or could
require mastectomy with or without loss of the nipple. Oncoplastic
procedures can be combined with surgery on the contralateral unaffected
breast to minimize long-term asymmetry.
Finally, decisions regarding breast reconstruction should primarily focus
on treatment of the tumor, and such treatment should not be
compromised.

same method of response assessment over time. For example, an
abnormality initially found on diagnostic CT scan of the chest should be
monitored with repeat diagnostic CT scans of the chest.
The optimal frequency of testing is uncertain, and is primarily based on the
monitoring strategies utilized in breast cancer clinical trials. The page titled
Principles of Monitoring Metastatic Disease in the algorithm provides a
table outlining general recommendations for the frequency and type of
monitoring as a baseline before initiation of new therapy, for monitoring
the effectiveness of cytotoxic chemotherapy and endocrine therapy, and
as an assessment when there is evidence of disease progression. The
panel has indicated in a footnote that the frequency of monitoring can be
reduced in patients who have long-term stable disease. These are
guidelines and should be modified for the individual patient using clinical
judgment, especially for those with stable or responding disease for long
periods of time.
The clinical use of Circulating Tumor Cells (CTC) or circulating DNA
(ctDNA) in metastatic breast cancer is not yet included in the NCCN
Guidelines for Breast Cancer for disease assessment and monitoring.

after 3 weeks of first-line chemotherapy in patients with persistently
increased CTC did not affect either PFS or OS.665

distinguish phyllodes tumors from fibroadenoma.680 Thus, in the setting of
a large or rapidly enlarging clinical fibroadenoma, excisional biopsy should
be considered to pathologically exclude a phyllodes tumor. Patients with
Li-Fraumeni syndrome (germline TP53 mutation, see NCCN Guidelines for

Treatment of phyllodes tumors (which includes benign, borderline, and
malignant subtypes) is with local surgical excision with tumor-free margins
of 1 cm or greater. Lumpectomy or partial mastectomy is the preferred
surgical therapy. Total mastectomy is necessary only if negative margins
cannot be obtained by lumpectomy or partial mastectomy.682 Since

Breast Cancer
with adenocarcinoma (or carcinoma not otherwise specified) of the
axillary nodes without evidence of a primary breast lesion. In particular,
breast MRI and ultrasound are recommended. Axillary ultrasound should
also be performed.
Treatment for Possible Primary Breast Cancer
Patients with MRI-positive breast disease should undergo evaluation with
ultrasound or MRI-guided biopsy and receive treatment according to the
clinical stage of the breast cancer. Treatment recommendations for those
with MRI-negative disease are based on nodal status. For patients with
T0, N1, M0 disease, options include mastectomy plus axillary nodal
dissection or axillary nodal dissection plus whole breast irradiation with
or without nodal irradiation. Systemic chemotherapy, endocrine therapy,
or trastuzumab is given according to the recommendations for stage II or
III disease. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy, trastuzumab, and endocrine
therapy should be considered for patients with T0, N2-N3, M0 disease
followed by axillary nodal dissection and mastectomy as for patients with
locally advanced disease.
Summary
The therapeutic options for patients with noninvasive or invasive breast
cancer are complex and varied. In many situations, the patient and
physician have the responsibility to jointly explore and select the most
appropriate option from among the available alternatives. With few
exceptions, the evaluation, treatment, and follow-up recommendations in
these guidelines are based on the results of past and present clinical
trials. However, there is not a single clinical situation in which the
treatment of breast cancer has been optimized with respect to either
maximizing cure or minimizing toxicity and disfigurement. Therefore,
patient/physician participation in prospective clinical trials allows patients
to not only receive state-of-the-art cancer treatment but also to contribute
to improving the treatment outcomes.
