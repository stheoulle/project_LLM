{"context": "Population studies and review articles in the dataset note disparities in breast cancer screening access and detection rates across racial and ethnic groups. Factors cited include differences in access to care, socioeconomic barriers, and in some cases differences in tumor subtype prevalence.

Research shows that race and ethnicity can affect how and when breast cancer is detected. Differences in access to screening, insurance, and follow-up care—rather than race itself—are major reasons some groups are diagnosed later. If you have concerns about screening or access, talk with your healthcare provider; they can help arrange appropriate tests and follow-up.

{"context": "Guidance documents in the collection summarize mammography as the primary screening test used to find breast cancer early, and note that different organizations recommend starting routine screening between ages 40 and 50 with regular intervals thereafter.

Decisions depend on your personal risk (family history, prior breast conditions) and local recommendations. Your doctor can help you decide the right age and frequency for you.

Many changes are benign, but see your healthcare provider promptly if you notice any of these so they can arrange an exam and any needed tests. Sources: [8577.00.txt]"}
{"context": "Several documents discuss that dense breast tissue can make mammograms harder to interpret and can lead to missed cancers. Supplemental imaging (ultrasound or MRI) is sometimes recommended for people with dense breasts or higher risk.

Dense breast tissue can hide cancers on a mammogram, making detection harder. If you have dense breasts, your doctor may recommend extra tests like ultrasound or MRI to improve detection.

{"context": "Fact sheets explain what a mammogram is: an X-ray image of the breast used to detect early cancers before symptoms appear.

Early detection increases the chance of successful treatment, which is why many people have routine mammograms based on their age and risk. Ask your provider about the schedule that fits you.
