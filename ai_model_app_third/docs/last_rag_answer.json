Cancer stage is the best begin in the milk glands (lobules) or in the tubes (ducts) predictor of prognosis (disease outcome) and is essential for that connect the milk glands to the nipple. guiding treatment options. The two main staging systems for breast cancer are the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system, typically used in clinical What are the signs and symptoms settings, and the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End of breast cancer? Results (SEER) summary staging system, reported by Breast cancer typically has no symptoms when the tumor cancer registries and used in surveillance research to is small and most easily treated, which is why breast measure the success of cancer control efforts. cancer screening is important for early detection. The most common physical sign is a painless lump. Sometimes The AJCC staging system incorporates anatomic and breast cancer can spread to underarm lymph nodes and biologic information about the cancer to create a cause a lump or swelling even before the original breast prognostic stage. Anatomic stage is based on TNM tumor is large enough to be felt. Less common signs and classification, including the size of the tumor (T) and symptoms include breast pain or heaviness; dimpling, whether cancer cells have spread to regional lymph nodes swelling, thickening, or redness of the breast skin; and (N) or have metastasized (M) to distant lymph nodes nipple changes, such as spontaneous discharge (especially and/or organs.

Breast Cancer Facts & Figures 2022-2024 1 What are the types of breast cancer? Figure 1. Distribution of Female Breast Cancer Breast cancer is a collection of many related diseases with Subtypes, US, 2015-2019 different biologic, clinical, and prognostic characteristics. HR-/HER2+ In addition to being classified by their stage (as previously 4% Unknown 8% described), breast cancers are further grouped based on microscopic appearance and molecular traits. HR-/HER2- 10% Ductal carcinoma in situ HR+/HER2+ Although ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is not a true 10% cancer, it represents about one in six newly diagnosed HR+/HER2- 68% breast cancers overall, and even more screen-detected cancers. DCIS, or stage 0 breast cancer, refers to presumably malignant cells that are confined to the mammary ducts. It is considered a precursor to invasive HR = hormone receptor; HER2 = human epidermal growth factor receptor 2. cancer and is associated with increased risk of subsequent Source: North American Association of Central Cancer Registries (NAACCR), 2022. invasive breast cancer. However, not all DCIS lesions ©2022, American Cancer Society, Inc., Surveillance and Health Equity Science progress to invasive cancer.1, 2 Although long-term follow-up studies of women with untreated DCIS report Histologic subtypes progression to invasive breast cancer ranging from 10% Histologic subtypes are based on the size, shape, and to 53%,3-5, 6 a recent modeling study suggests that over arrangement of cancer cells.

See breast cancer risk factors on page 12 for information on LCIS (lobular carcinoma in situ) and additional Molecular subtypes information on DCIS. Breast cancer is further classified by molecular characteristics that are associated with clinical Invasive presentation, response to therapy, and prognosis. The four Most (83%) breast cancers are invasive, or infiltrating, broad molecular subtypes are Luminal A, Luminal B, which means the cancer cells have broken through the basal-like, and HER2-enriched. These subtypes were wall of the glands or ducts where they originated and originally defined by gene expression profiling but are grown into surrounding breast tissue with the potential often approximated based on simpler tests that determine to spread to other parts of the body.

Information about tumor grade and proliferation (rate of cell division) is also sometimes used to assign subtype.13 2 Breast Cancer Facts & Figures 2022-2024 • HR+/HER2- Surrogate for Luminal A. This is the This is generally a more aggressive type of tumor, most common molecular subtype of breast cancer, with higher risk of metastasis and recurrence.16, 17 accounting for 68% of all cases (Figure 1). This subtype TNBC accounts for 10% of breast cancers overall, but tends to be slower-growing and less aggressive than nearly 20% among African American women, who other subtypes and responds to hormone therapy have the highest incidence. Risk is also higher among (see page 28).14 young women and those with a BRCA1 gene variant.18-20 • HR+/HER2+ Surrogate for Luminal B. This subtype • HR-/HER2+ Surrogate for HER2-enriched.

With BCS Women who undergo mastectomy may have breast (also known as partial mastectomy or lumpectomy), only reconstruction, which is done either at the time of cancerous tissue, plus a rim of normal tissue (tumor mastectomy or after further cancer treatment. margin), is removed.

The presence of cancer BCS-eligible patients in the US are increasingly electing cells in the lymph nodes increases the risk of recurrence, contralateral mastectomy, which has risen among women so results from the SLNB can help determine whether with breast cancer from 4% in the early 2000s to 13% in further treatment is needed. Breast cancer patients who 2012, despite equivalent survival when BCS is combined are ≥70 years of age who have early-stage HR+ tumors with radiation.271 Reasons for this include fear of may not require an SLNB.277 Some breast cancer patients recurrence, reluctance or contraindication to receiving need more extensive lymph node surgery, called an radiation (e.g., prior ipsilateral radiation), and desire for axillary lymph node dissection (ALND).

Radiation therapy Systemic drug therapy Radiation therapy is often used after surgery to destroy Systemic therapies are drugs that travel through the cancer cells remaining in the breast, chest wall, or bloodstream, reaching most parts of the body, and work underarm area and reduce the risk local of recurrence. using different mechanisms. For example, chemotherapy Radiation therapy after BCS is standard for most drugs generally attack all cells that grow quickly, such as patients, as it has been shown to reduce the risk of cancer cancer cells, but may attack normal cells (e.g., those that recurrence by about 50% at 10 years and the risk of breast produce hair) as well. Hormonal therapy works by either cancer death by almost 20% at 15 years.288 However, blocking or decreasing the level of the body’s natural evidence from randomized control trials has suggested hormones, which sometimes promote cancer growth. adjuvant radiation may be omitted without impacting Targeted drug therapies work by attacking specific survival in certain subsets of patients receiving BCS, proteins on cancer cells (or nearby cells) that help them such as women ≥70 years of age with small, localized, grow. Immunotherapy stimulates the patient’s immune hormone receptor (HR) positive tumors taking hormone system to attack cancer cells. Systemic therapies often therapy.289, 290 Older patients with HR+ tumors who opt are used in combination with each other, particularly to omit radiation must be aware of the heightened for advanced or recurrent disease. importance of adhering to their prescribed hormone therapy regimen. When systemic drug therapy is given to patients before surgery, it is called neoadjuvant or preoperative therapy. Patients treated with mastectomy can also benefit from For larger breast tumors, it is often used to shrink the radiation if their tumor is larger than 5 centimeters, tumor enough to make surgical removal easier and less growing into nearby tissues, or if cancer is found in the extensive (such as BCS in women who would otherwise lymph nodes.

The number of trends are based on the National Cancer Institute’s invasive breast cancer cases and DCIS diagnosed in 2022 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) 8 was calculated by estimating complete case counts registries, which account for about 8% of the US population. during 2004-2018 in all 50 states and the District of Analyses of trends by race/ethnicity (2000-2019) and by Columbia using a spatiotemporal model that considers stage at diagnosis (2004-2019) were based on SEER 22 state variation in sociodemographic and lifestyle factors, and 17 registry incidence data, respectively, and adjusted medical settings, and cancer screening behaviors, and for reporting delay using delay factors. also accounts for expected delays in case reporting. Input data for the model was cancer occurrence information Estimated cancer deaths. The overall estimated number from cancer registries that consented to participate and of breast cancer deaths in the US is calculated by fitting met the North American Association of Central Cancer the number of breast cancer deaths for 2006-2020 to a Registries’ (NAACCR) high-quality data standards. The statistical model that forecasts the number of deaths NAACCR is an umbrella organization that sets standards expected to occur in 2022. Data on the number of deaths and aggregates and disseminates incidence data are obtained from the National Center for Health Statistics collected by cancer registries in the National Cancer (NCHS) at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Institute’s (NCI) Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End (CDC).

Breast cancer is a type of cancer that starts in the breast. It can start in one or both breasts. How breast cancer starts l Where breast cancer starts l How breast cancer spreads l Types of breast cancer l How breast cancer starts Breast cancer occurs almost entirely in women, but men can get breast cancer1, too. Cancer starts when cells begin to grow out of control. (To learn more about how cancers start and spread, see What Is Cancer?2) It’s important to understand that most breast lumps are benign and not cancer (malignant). Non-cancer breast tumors are abnormal growths, but they do not spread outside of the breast. They are not life threatening, but some types of benign breast lumps can increase a woman's risk of getting breast cancer. Any breast lump or change needs to be checked by a health care professional to find out if it is benign or malignant (cancer) and if it might affect your future cancer risk. See Non-cancerous Breast Conditions3 to learn more. Where breast cancer starts Breast cancers can start from different parts of the breast. The breast is an organ that sits on top of the upper ribs and chest muscles. There is a left and right breast and each one has mainly glands, ducts, and fatty tissue. In women, the breast makes and delivers milk to feed newborns and infants. The amount of fatty tissue in the breast determines the size of each breast. The breast has different parts: 2 _A_m__e_ri_ca_n_ _C_a_n_c_e_r_ S_o_c_i_e_ty_________________________________________c_a_n_c_e_r._o_rg_ _| _1_.8_0_0_._2_2_7_.2_3_4_5__ Lobules are the glands that make breast milk. Cancers that start here are called l lobular cancers. Ducts are small canals that come out from the lobules and carry the milk to the l nipple. This is the most common place for breast cancer to start. Cancers that start here are called ductal cancers. The nipple is the opening in the skin of the breast where the ducts come together l and turn into larger ducts so the milk can leave the breast. The nipple is surrounded by slightly darker thicker skin called the areola. A less common type of breast cancer called Paget disease of the breast can start in the nipple. The fat and connective tissue (stroma) surround the ducts and lobules and help l keep them in place. A less common type of breast cancer called phyllodes tumor4 can start in the stroma. Blood vessels and lymph vessels are also found in each breast. Angiosarcoma is l a less common type of breast cancer that can start in the lining of these vessels. The lymph system is described below. A small number of cancers start in other tissues in the breast. These cancers are called sarcomas5 and lymphomas6 and are not really thought of as breast cancers. To learn more, see Types of Breast Cancer. 3 _A_m__e_ri_ca_n_ _C_a_n_c_e_r_ S_o_c_i_e_ty_________________________________________c_a_n_c_e_r._o_rg_ _| _1_.8_0_0_._2_2_7_.2_3_4_5__ How breast cancer spreads Breast cancer can spread when the cancer cells get into the blood or lymph system and then are carried to other parts of the body. The lymph (or lymphatic) system is a part of your body's immune system. It is a network of lymph nodes (small, bean-sized glands), ducts or vessels, and organs that work together to collect and carry clear lymph fluid through the body tissues to the blood. The clear lymph fluid inside the lymph vessels contains tissue by-products and waste material, as well as immune system cells. The lymph vessels carry lymph fluid away from the breast. In the case of breast cancer, cancer cells can enter those lymph vessels and start to grow in lymph nodes. Most of the lymph vessels of the breast drain into: 4 _A_m__e_ri_ca_n_ _C_a_n_c_e_r_ S_o_c_i_e_ty_________________________________________c_a_n_c_e_r._o_rg_ _| _1_.8_0_0_._2_2_7_.2_3_4_5__ Lymph nodes under the arm (axillary lymph nodes) l Lymph nodes inside the chest near the breastbone (internal mammary lymph l nodes) Lymph nodes around the collar bone (supraclavicular [above the collar bone] and l infraclavicular [below the collar bone] lymph nodes) If cancer cells have spread to your lymph nodes, there is a higher chance that the cells could have traveled through the lymph system and spread (metastasized) to other parts of your body. Still, not all women with cancer cells in their lymph nodes develop metastases, and some women with no cancer cells in their lymph nodes might develop metastases later. 5 _A_m__e_ri_ca_n_ _C_a_n_c_e_r_ S_o_c_i_e_ty_________________________________________c_a_n_c_e_r._o_rg_ _| _1_.8_0_0_._2_2_7_.2_3_4_5__ Types of breast cancer There are many different types of breast cancer.

Other kinds of cancers can grow in the breast, like angiosarcoma or sarcoma7, but are not considered breast cancer since they start in different cells of the breast. Breast cancers are also classified by certain types of proteins or genes each cancer might make. After a biopsy is done, breast cancer cells are tested for proteins called estrogen receptors and progesterone receptors8, and the HER2 gene or protein9. The tumor cells are also closely looked at in the lab to find out what grade10 it is. The specific proteins found and the tumor grade can help decide the stage of the cancer and treatment options.

See Lifestyle-related Breast Cancer Risk Factors1 and Breast Cancer Risk Factors You Cannot Change2. 8 _A_m__e_ri_ca_n_ _C_a_n_c_e_r_ S_o_c_i_e_ty_________________________________________c_a_n_c_e_r._o_rg_ _| _1_.8_0_0_._2_2_7_.2_3_4_5__ Hormones Hormones also seem to play a role in many cases of breast cancer, but just how this happens is not fully understood. Gene mutations We do know that normal breast cells can become cancer because of changes or mutations in genes. But only about 1 in 10 breast cancers (10%) are linked with known abnormal genes that are passed on from parents (inherited). Many genes have not yet been discovered, so women with a family history of breast cancer might have inherited an abnormal gene that doesn't show on a genetic test3. Most breast cancers (about 90%) develop from acquired (not inherited) gene changes that have not yet been identified. How gene changes can lead to breast cancer Genes4 control how our cells function. They are made up of a chemical called DNA, which comes from both our parents. DNA affects more than just how we look; it also can influence our risk for developing certain diseases, including some kinds of cancer. Normal cells have genes called proto-oncogenes, which help control when the cells grow, divide to make new cells, or stay alive. If a proto-oncogene is mutated (changed) in a certain way, it becomes an oncogene. Cells that have these mutated oncogenes can become cancer. Normal cells also have genes called tumor suppressor genes, which help control how often normal cells divide in two, repair DNA mistakes, or cause cells to die at the right time. If a cell has a mutated tumor suppressor gene, then the cell can turn into cancer. Cancers can be caused by gene changes that turn on oncogenes or turn off tumor suppressor genes. Changes in many different genes are usually needed to cause breast cancer. Inherited gene changes Some gene changes (mutations) are inherited or passed to you from your parents. This means the mutations are in all your cells when you are born. Certain inherited gene changes can greatly increase the risk for developing certain 9 _A_m__e_ri_ca_n_ _C_a_n_c_e_r_ S_o_c_i_e_ty_________________________________________c_a_n_c_e_r._o_rg_ _| _1_.8_0_0_._2_2_7_.2_3_4_5__ cancers and are linked to many of the cancers that run in some families. For instance, the BRCA genes (BRCA1 and BRCA2) are tumor suppressor genes. When one of these genes changes, it no longer suppresses abnormal cell growth, and cancer is more likely to develop. A change in one of these genes can be passed from a parent to a child. Women have already begun to benefit from advances in understanding the genetic basis of breast cancer. Genetic testing can identify some women who have inherited mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 tumor suppressor genes as well as other less common genes such as PALB2, ATM, or CHEK2. These women can then take steps to reduce their risk of breast cancer by increasing awareness of their breasts and following appropriate screening recommendations5 to help find cancer at an earlier, more treatable stage. Since these mutations are also often associated with other cancers (besides breast), women with these mutations might also consider early screening and preventive actions for other cancers. Mutations in tumor suppressor genes like the BRCA genes are considered “high penetrance” because they often lead to cancer. Although many women with high penetrance mutations develop cancer, most cases of cancer (including breast cancer) are not caused by this kind of mutation. More often, low-penetrance mutations or gene variations are a factor in cancer development. Each of these may have a small effect on cancer occurring in any one person, but the overall effect on the population can be large because the mutations are common, and people often have more than one at the same time. The genes involved can affect things like hormone levels, metabolism, or other factors that impact risk for breast cancer. These genes might also cause much of the risk of breast cancer that runs in families. Acquired gene changes Most gene mutations linked to breast cancer are acquired. This means the change takes place in breast cells during a person's life rather than having been inherited or born with them. Acquired DNA mutations take place over time and are only in the breast cancer cells. These acquired mutations of oncogenes and/or tumor suppressor genes may result from other factors, like radiation or cancer-causing chemicals. But some gene changes may just be random events that sometimes happen inside a cell, without having an outside cause. So far, the causes of most acquired mutations that could lead to breast cancer are still unknown. Most breast cancers have several acquired gene mutations. 10 _A_m__e_ri_ca_n_ _C_a_n_c_e_r_ S_o_c_i_e_ty_________________________________________c_a_n_c_e_r._o_rg_ _| _1_.8_0_0_._2_2_7_.2_3_4_5__ Hyperlinks 1. www.cancer.org/cancer/types/breast-cancer/risk-and-prevention/lifestyle-related- breast-cancer-risk-factors.html 2. www.cancer.org/cancer/types/breast-cancer/risk-and-prevention/breast-cancer- risk-factors-you-cannot-change.html 3. www.cancer.org/cancer/types/breast-cancer/risk-and-prevention/genetic- testing.html 4. www.cancer.org/cancer/understanding-cancer/genes-and-cancer.html 5. www.cancer.org/cancer/types/breast-cancer/screening-tests-and-early- detection/american-cancer-society-recommendations-for-the-early-detection-of- breast-cancer.html References Berger AH and Pandolfi PP.

It’s easy to get confused. A breast cancer's type is determined by the specific cells in the breast that become cancer. Ductal or lobular carcinoma l Less common types of breast cancer l Ductal or lobular carcinoma Most breast cancers are carcinomas, which are tumors that start in the epithelial cells that line organs and tissues throughout the body. When carcinomas form in the breast, they are usually a more specific type called adenocarcinoma, which starts in cells in the ducts (the milk ducts) or the lobules (glands in the breast that make milk). In situ vs. invasive breast cancers The type of breast cancer can also refer to whether the cancer has spread or not. In situ breast cancer (ductal carcinoma in situ or DCIS) is a pre-cancer that starts in a milk duct and has not grown into the rest of the breast tissue. The term invasive (or infiltrating) breast cancer is used to describe any type of breast cancer that has spread (invaded) into the surrounding breast tissue. Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS; also known as intraductal carcinoma) is a non-invasive or pre-invasive breast cancer. Invasive breast cancer (ILC or IDC) Invasive (or infiltrating) breast cancer has spread into surrounding breast tissue. The most common types are invasive ductal carcinoma and invasive lobular carcinoma. Invasive ductal carcinoma makes up about 70-80% of all breast cancers. Special types of invasive breast cancers Some invasive breast cancers have special features or develop in different ways that influence their treatment and outlook. These cancers are less common but can be more serious than other types of breast cancer. 12 _A_m__e_ri_ca_n_ _C_a_n_c_e_r_ S_o_c_i_e_ty_________________________________________c_a_n_c_e_r._o_rg_ _| _1_.8_0_0_._2_2_7_.2_3_4_5__ Triple-negative breast cancer Triple-negative breast cancer is an aggressive type of invasive breast cancer in which the cancer cells don’t have estrogen or progesterone receptors (ER or PR) and also don’t make any or too much of the protein called HER2. (The cells test \"negative\" on all 3 tests.) It accounts for about 15% of all breast cancers and can be a difficult cancer to treat. Inflammatory breast cancer Inflammatory breast cancer is an aggressive type of invasive breast cancer in which cancer cells block lymph vessels in the skin, causing the breast to look \"inflamed.\" It is rare and accounts for about 1% to 5% of all breast cancers. Less common types of breast cancer There are other types of breast cancers that start to grow in other types of cells in the breast. These cancers are much less common, and sometimes need different types of treatment. Paget disease of the breast Paget disease of the breast is rare, accounting for only about 1-3% of all cases of breast cancer. It starts in the breast ducts and spreads to the skin of the nipple and then to the areola (the dark circle around the nipple). Angiosarcoma Sarcomas of the breast are rare making up less than 1% of all breast cancers. Angiosarcoma starts in cells that line blood vessels or lymph vessels. It can involve the breast tissue or the skin of the breast. Some may be related to prior radiation therapy in that area. Phyllodes tumor Phyllodes tumors are rare breast tumors. They develop in the connective tissue (stroma) of the breast, in contrast to carcinomas, which develop in the ducts or lobules. Most are benign, but there are others that are malignant (cancer).

It is also known as intraductal carcinoma. Treating DCIS l About 1 in 5 new breast cancers will be ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Nearly all women with this early stage of breast cancer can be cured. DCIS is also called intraductal carcinoma or stage 0 breast cancer. DCIS is a non- invasive or pre-invasive breast cancer. This means the cells that line the ducts have changed to cancer cells but they have not spread through the walls of the ducts into the nearby breast tissue. 15 _A_m__e_ri_ca_n_ _C_a_n_c_e_r_ S_o_c_i_e_ty_________________________________________c_a_n_c_e_r._o_rg_ _| _1_.8_0_0_._2_2_7_.2_3_4_5__ Because DCIS hasn’t spread into the breast tissue around it, it can’t spread (metastasize) beyond the breast to other parts of the body. However, DCIS can sometimes become an invasive cancer. At that time, the cancer has spread out of the duct into nearby tissue, and from there, it could metastasize to other parts of the body. Right now, there’s no good way to know for sure which will become invasive cancer and which ones won’t, so almost all women with DCIS will be treated. Treating DCIS 16 _A_m__e_ri_ca_n_ _C_a_n_c_e_r_ S_o_c_i_e_ty_________________________________________c_a_n_c_e_r._o_rg_ _| _1_.8_0_0_._2_2_7_.2_3_4_5__ In most cases, a woman with DCIS can choose between breast-conserving surgery (BCS) and simple mastectomy. Radiation is usually given after BCS. Tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor after surgery might also be an option if the DCIS is hormone- receptor positive1.

Last Revised: November 19, 2021 Invasive Breast Cancer (IDC/ILC) Breast cancers that have spread into surrounding breast tissue are known as invasive breast cancers. Most breast cancers are invasive, but there are different types of invasive breast cancer. The two most common types are invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) and invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC). Inflammatory breast cancer and triple negative breast cancer are also types of invasive breast cancer. Invasive (infiltrating) ductal carcinoma (IDC) l Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) l Less common types of invasive breast cancer l Treating invasive breast cancer l Invasive (infiltrating) ductal carcinoma (IDC) This is the most common type of breast cancer. About 8 in 10 invasive breast cancers are invasive (or infiltrating) ductal carcinomas (IDC). IDC starts in the cells that line a milk duct in the breast. From there, the cancer breaks through the wall of the duct, and grows into the nearby breast tissues. At this point, it may be able to spread (metastasize) to other parts of the body through the lymph system and bloodstream. Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) About 1 in 10 invasive breast cancers is an invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC). ILC starts in the breast glands that make milk (lobules). Like IDC, it can spread 18 _A_m__e_ri_ca_n_ _C_a_n_c_e_r_ S_o_c_i_e_ty_________________________________________c_a_n_c_e_r._o_rg_ _| _1_.8_0_0_._2_2_7_.2_3_4_5__ (metastasize) to other parts of the body. Invasive lobular carcinoma may be harder to detect on physical exam and imaging, like mammograms, than invasive ductal carcinoma. And compared to other kinds of invasive carcinoma, it is more likely to affect both breasts. About 1 in 5 women with ILC might have cancer in both breasts at the time they are diagnosed. Less common types of invasive breast cancer There are some special types of breast cancer that are sub-types of invasive carcinoma. They are less common than the breast cancers named above and each typically make up fewer than 5% of all breast cancers. These are often named after features of the cancer cells, like the ways the cells are arranged. Some of these may have a better prognosis than the more common IDC. These include: Adenoid cystic (or adenocystic) carcinoma l Low-grade adenosquamous carcinoma (this is a type of metaplastic carcinoma) l Medullary carcinoma l Mucinous (or colloid) carcinoma l Papillary carcinoma l Tubular carcinoma l Some sub-types have the same or maybe worse prognoses than IDC. These include: Metaplastic carcinoma (most types, including spindle cell and squamous, except l low grade adenosquamous carcinoma) Micropapillary carcinoma l Mixed carcinoma (has features of both invasive ductal and invasive lobular) l In general, all of these sub-types are still treated like IDC. Treating invasive breast cancer Treatment of invasive breast cancer depends on how advanced the cancer is (the stage of the cancer) and other factors. Most women will have some type of surgery to remove the tumor. Depending on the type of breast cancer and how advanced it is, you might need other types of treatment as well, either before or after surgery, or sometimes both.

Last Revised: November 19, 2021 Triple-negative Breast Cancer Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive type of invasive breast cancer. 20 _A_m__e_ri_ca_n_ _C_a_n_c_e_r_ S_o_c_i_e_ty_________________________________________c_a_n_c_e_r._o_rg_ _| _1_.8_0_0_._2_2_7_.2_3_4_5__ TNBC differs from other types of invasive breast cancer in that it tends to grow and spread faster, has fewer treatment options, and tends to have a worse prognosis (outlook). The term triple-negative breast cancer refers to the fact that the cancer cells don’t have estrogen or progesterone receptors1 (ER or PR) and also don’t have too much of the HER22 protein. (The cells test \"negative\" on all 3 tests.) How common is triple-negative breast cancer? l Signs and symptoms of triple-negative breast cancer l How is triple-negative breast cancer diagnosed? l Survival rates for triple-negative breast cancer l Treating triple-negative breast cancer l How common is triple-negative breast cancer? Triple-negative breast cancer accounts for about 10-15% of all breast cancers. These cancers tend to be more common in women younger than age 40, who are Black, or who have a BRCA1 mutation. Signs and symptoms of triple-negative breast cancer Triple-negative breast cancer can have the same signs and symptoms3 as other common types of breast cancer. How is triple-negative breast cancer diagnosed? Once a breast cancer diagnosis has been made using imaging tests and a biopsy4, the cancer cells will be checked for certain proteins. If the cells do not have estrogen or progesterone receptors (ER or PR), and also do not have too much of the HER2 protein, the cancer is considered to be triple-negative breast cancer. Survival rates for triple-negative breast cancer TNBC tends to grow quickly, is more likely to have spread at the time it’s found, and is more likely to come back after treatment than other types of breast cancer. Because of this, the survival rates for TNBC are generally not quite as high as they are for other types of breast cancer. 21 _A_m__e_ri_ca_n_ _C_a_n_c_e_r_ S_o_c_i_e_ty_________________________________________c_a_n_c_e_r._o_rg_ _| _1_.8_0_0_._2_2_7_.2_3_4_5__ Survival rates can give you an idea of what percentage of people with the same type and stage of cancer are still alive a certain amount of time (usually 5 years) after they were diagnosed. They can’t tell you how long you will live, but they may help give you a better understanding of how likely it is that your treatment will be successful. Keep in mind that survival rates are estimates and are often based on previous outcomes of large numbers of people who had a specific cancer, but they can’t predict what will happen in any particular person’s case. These statistics can be confusing and may lead you to have more questions. Talk with your doctor about how these numbers may apply to you, as they are familiar with your situation. What is a 5-year relative survival rate? A relative survival rate compares women with the same type and stage of breast cancer to women in the overall population. For example, if the 5-year relative survival rate for a specific stage of breast cancer is 90%, it means that women who have that cancer are, on average, about 90% as likely as women who don’t have that cancer to live for at least 5 years after being diagnosed. Where do these numbers come from? The American Cancer Society relies on information from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER) database, maintained by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), to provide survival statistics for different types of cancer. The SEER database tracks 5-year relative survival rates for breast cancer in the United States, based on how far the cancer has spread. The SEER database, however, does not group cancers by AJCC TNM stages5 (stage 1, stage 2, stage 3, etc.). Instead, it groups cancers into localized, regional, and distant stages: Localized: There is no sign that the cancer has spread outside of the breast. l Regional: The cancer has spread outside the breast to nearby structures or lymph l nodes. Distant: The cancer has spread to distant parts of the body such as the lungs, liver, l or bones. 5-year relative survival rates for triple-negative breast cancer These numbers are based on women diagnosed with TNBC between 2015 and 2021. 22 _A_m__e_ri_ca_n_ _C_a_n_c_e_r_ S_o_c_i_e_ty_________________________________________c_a_n_c_e_r._o_rg_ _| _1_.8_0_0_._2_2_7_.2_3_4_5__ SEER Stage 5-year Relative Survival Rate Localized 92% Regional 67% Distant 15% 78% All stages combined Understanding the numbers Women now being diagnosed with TNBC may have a better outlook than l these numbers show. Treatments improve over time, and these numbers are based on women who were diagnosed and treated at least 5 years earlier. These numbers apply only to the stage of the cancer when it is first l diagnosed. They do not apply later on if the cancer grows, spreads, or comes back after treatment. These numbers don’t take everything into account. Survival rates are grouped l based on how far the cancer has spread, but your age and overall health, how well the cancer responds to treatment, tumor grade6, and other factors can also affect your outlook. Treating triple-negative breast cancer Triple-negative breast cancer has fewer treatment options than other types of invasive breast cancer. This is because the cancer cells do not have the estrogen or progesterone receptors or enough of the HER2 protein to make hormone therapy or HER2-targeted drugs work. Because hormone therapy and anti-HER2 drugs are not choices for women with triple-negative breast cancer, chemotherapy is often used. If the cancer has not spread to distant sites, surgery is an option. Chemotherapy might be given first to shrink a large tumor, followed by surgery. Chemotherapy is often recommended after surgery to reduce the chances of the cancer coming back. Radiation might also be an option depending on certain features of the tumor and the type of surgery you had. In cases where the cancer has spread to other parts of the body (stage IV), platinum chemotherapy, targeted drugs like a PARP inhibitor or antibody-drug conjugate, or 23 _A_m__e_ri_ca_n_ _C_a_n_c_e_r_ S_o_c_i_e_ty_________________________________________c_a_n_c_e_r._o_rg_ _| _1_.8_0_0_._2_2_7_.2_3_4_5__ immunotherapy with chemotherapy might be considered.

Last Revised: June 25, 2025 Inflammatory Breast Cancer Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is a rare and aggressive type of invasive breast cancer in which cancer cells block lymph vessels in the skin. This causes the breast to look “inflamed.” What is inflammatory breast cancer? l Signs and symptoms of inflammatory breast cancer l How is inflammatory breast cancer diagnosed? l Stages of inflammatory breast cancer l Survival rates for inflammatory breast cancer l Treating inflammatory breast cancer l What is inflammatory breast cancer? 25 _A_m__e_ri_ca_n_ _C_a_n_c_e_r_ S_o_c_i_e_ty_________________________________________c_a_n_c_e_r._o_rg_ _| _1_.8_0_0_._2_2_7_.2_3_4_5__ Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is rare. It accounts for only 1% to 5% of all breast cancers. Although it is a type of invasive ductal carcinoma, its symptoms, outlook, and treatment are different. IBC causes symptoms of breast inflammation like swelling and redness, which is caused by cancer cells blocking lymph vessels in the skin causing the breast to look \"inflamed.\" Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) differs from other types of breast cancer in many ways: IBC doesn't look like a typical breast cancer. It often does not cause a breast lump, l and it might not show up on a mammogram. This makes it harder to diagnose. IBC tends to occur in younger women (younger than 40 years of age). l Black women appear to develop IBC more often than White women. l IBC is more common among women who have excess body weight (overweight or l obesity). IBC tends to be more aggressive—it grows and spreads much more quickly—than l more common types of breast cancer. IBC is always at least at a locally advanced stage when it’s first diagnosed because l the breast cancer cells have grown into the skin. (This means it is at least stage III.) In about 1 of 3 cases, IBC has already spread (metastasized) to distant parts of the l body when it is diagnosed. This makes it harder to treat successfully. Women with IBC tend to have a worse prognosis (outcome) than women with other l common types of breast cancer. Signs and symptoms of inflammatory breast cancer Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) can cause a number of signs and symptoms, most of which develop quickly (within 3 to 6 months), including: Swelling (edema) of the skin of the breast l Redness involving more than one-third of the breast l Pitting or thickening of the skin of the breast so that it may look and feel like an l orange peel A retracted or inverted nipple l One breast looking larger than the other because of swelling l One breast feeling warmer and heavier than the other l A breast that may be tender, painful, or itchy l Swelling of the lymph nodes under the arms or near the collarbone l 26 _A_m__e_ri_ca_n_ _C_a_n_c_e_r_ S_o_c_i_e_ty_________________________________________c_a_n_c_e_r._o_rg_ _| _1_.8_0_0_._2_2_7_.2_3_4_5__ If you have any of these symptoms, it does not mean that you have IBC, but you should see a doctor right away. Tenderness, redness, warmth, and itching are also common symptoms of a breast infection or inflammation, such as mastitis1 if you’re pregnant or breastfeeding. Because these problems are much more common than IBC, your doctor might suspect infection at first as a cause and treat you with antibiotics. Treatment with antibiotics may be a good first step, but if your symptoms don’t get better in 7 to 10 days, more tests need to be done to look for cancer. Let your doctor know if it doesn't help, especially if the symptoms get worse or the affected area gets larger. The possibility of IBC should be considered more strongly if you have these symptoms and are not pregnant or breastfeeding, or have been through menopause. Ask to see a specialist (like a breast surgeon) if you’re concerned. IBC grows and spreads quickly, so the cancer may have already spread to nearby lymph nodes by the time symptoms are noticed. This spread can cause swollen lymph 27 _A_m__e_ri_ca_n_ _C_a_n_c_e_r_ S_o_c_i_e_ty_________________________________________c_a_n_c_e_r._o_rg_ _| _1_.8_0_0_._2_2_7_.2_3_4_5__ nodes under your arm or above your collar bone. If the diagnosis is delayed, the cancer can spread to distant sites. How is inflammatory breast cancer diagnosed? Imaging tests If inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is suspected, one or more of the following imaging tests may be done: Mammogram2 l Breast ultrasound3 l Breast MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan4 l Often a photo of the breast is taken to help record the amount of redness and swelling before starting treatment. Biopsy Inflammatory breast cancer is diagnosed by a biopsy5, taking out a small piece of the breast tissue and looking at it in the lab. This might mean a punch biopsy6 of the breast skin that is abnormal. Your physical exam and other tests may show findings that are \"suspicious for\" IBC, but only a biopsy can tell for sure that it is cancer. Tests on biopsy samples The cancer cells in the biopsy will be examined in the lab to determine their grade7. They will also be tested for certain proteins that help decide which treatments will be helpful. Women whose breast cancer cells have hormone receptors8 are likely to benefit from treatment with hormone therapy drugs. Cancer cells that make too much of a protein called HER29 or too many copies of the gene for that protein may be treated by certain drugs that target HER2. In certain cases, other gene mutations (changes) or proteins10 might be tested for to see if specific drugs might be helpful. Stages of inflammatory breast cancer 28 _A_m__e_ri_ca_n_ _C_a_n_c_e_r_ S_o_c_i_e_ty_________________________________________c_a_n_c_e_r._o_rg_ _| _1_.8_0_0_._2_2_7_.2_3_4_5__ All inflammatory breast cancers start as stage III (T4dNXM0) since they involve the skin. If the cancer has spread outside the breast to distant parts of the body, it is stage IV. For more information, read about breast cancer staging11. Survival rates for inflammatory breast cancer Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) tends to grow quickly, is more likely to have spread at the time it’s found, and is more likely to come back after treatment than most other types of breast cancer. Because of this, the survival rates are generally not as high as they are for other types of breast cancer. Survival rates can give you an idea of what percentage of people with the same type and stage of cancer are still alive a certain amount of time (usually 5 years) after they were diagnosed. They can’t tell you how long you will live, but they may help give you a better understanding of how likely it is that your treatment will be successful. Keep in mind that survival rates are estimates and are often based on previous outcomes of large numbers of people who had a specific cancer, but they can’t predict what will happen in any particular person’s case. These statistics can be confusing and may lead you to have more questions. Ask your doctor how these numbers may apply to you, as they are familiar with your situation. What is a 5-year relative survival rate? A relative survival rate compares women with the same type and stage of breast cancer to women in the overall population. For example, if the 5-year relative survival rate for a specific stage of breast cancer is 70%, it means that women who have that cancer are, on average, about 70% as likely as women who don’t have that cancer to live for at least 5 years after being diagnosed. Where do these numbers come from? The American Cancer Society relies on information from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, maintained by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), to provide survival statistics for different types of cancer. The SEER database tracks 5-year relative survival rates for breast cancer in the United States, based on how far the cancer has spread. The SEER database, however, does not group cancers by AJCC TNM stages12 (stage 1, stage 2, stage 3, etc.). Instead, it 29 _A_m__e_ri_ca_n_ _C_a_n_c_e_r_ S_o_c_i_e_ty_________________________________________c_a_n_c_e_r._o_rg_ _| _1_.8_0_0_._2_2_7_.2_3_4_5__ groups cancers into localized, regional, and distant stages: Localized: There is no sign that the cancer has spread outside of the breast. l Regional: The cancer has spread outside the breast to nearby structures or lymph l nodes. Distant: The cancer has spread to distant parts of the body such as the lungs, liver, l or bones. 5-year relative survival rates for inflammatory breast cancer These numbers are based on women diagnosed with IBC between 2015 and 2021. (There is no localized SEER stage for IBC since it has already reached the skin when first diagnosed.) SEER Stage 5-year Relative Survival Rate Regional 53% Distant 22% All SEER Stages 40% Understanding the numbers Women now being diagnosed with inflammatory breast cancer may have a l better outlook than these numbers show. Treatments improve over time, and these numbers are based on women who were diagnosed and treated at least 5 years earlier. These numbers apply only to the stage of the cancer when it is first l diagnosed. They do not apply later on if the cancer grows, spreads, or comes back after treatment. These numbers don’t take everything into account. Survival rates are grouped l based on how far the cancer has spread, but your age and overall health, how well the cancer responds to treatment, tumor grade13, and other factors can also affect your outlook. Treating inflammatory breast cancer Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) that has not spread outside the breast is stage III. In 30 _A_m__e_ri_ca_n_ _C_a_n_c_e_r_ S_o_c_i_e_ty_________________________________________c_a_n_c_e_r._o_rg_ _| _1_.8_0_0_._2_2_7_.2_3_4_5__ most cases, treatment is chemotherapy first to try to shrink the tumor, followed by surgery to remove the cancer. Radiation and often other treatments, like more chemotherapy or targeted drug therapy, are given after surgery. Because IBC is so aggressive, breast conserving surgery (lumpectomy) and sentinel lymph node biopsy are typically not part of the treatment. IBC that has spread to other parts of the body (stage IV) may be treated with chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and/or targeted drugs. For details, see Treatment of Inflammatory Breast Cancer14.

Only a biopsy can tell for sure that it is cancer. Treating angiosarcoma Angiosarcomas tend to grow and spread quickly. Treatment usually includes surgery6 to remove the breast (mastectomy). The axillary lymph nodes are typically not removed. Radiation7 might be given in certain cases of angiosarcomas that are not related to prior breast radiation.

Signs and symptoms of Paget disease of the breast l How is Paget disease of the breast diagnosed? l Treating Paget disease of the breast l Signs and symptoms of Paget disease of the breast The skin of the nipple and areola often looks crusted, scaly, and red. There may be blood or yellow fluid coming out of the nipple. Sometimes the nipple looks flat or inverted. It also might burn or itch. Your doctor might try to treat this as eczema first, and if it does not improve, recommend a biopsy. Paget disease usually affects only one breast. In 80-90% of cases, it’s usually found along with either ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or infiltrating ductal carcinoma (invasive breast cancer). How is Paget disease of the breast diagnosed? Most people with Paget disease of the breast also have tumors in the same breast. One or more of the following imaging tests may be done to check for other breast changes: Diagnostic mammogram1 l Breast ultrasound2 l Breast MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan3 l Paget disease of the breast is diagnosed by a biopsy4, removing a small piece of the breast tissue and looking at it closely in the lab. In some cases, the entire nipple may be removed. Only a biopsy can show for sure that it is cancer. Treating Paget disease of the breast Paget disease can be treated by removing the entire breast (mastectomy5) or breast- conserving surgery6 (BCS) followed by whole-breast radiation therapy7. If BCS is done, the entire nipple and areola area also needs to be removed. If invasive cancer is found, 36 _A_m__e_ri_ca_n_ _C_a_n_c_e_r_ S_o_c_i_e_ty_________________________________________c_a_n_c_e_r._o_rg_ _| _1_.8_0_0_._2_2_7_.2_3_4_5__ the lymph nodes under the arm will be checked for cancer. If no lump is felt in the breast tissue, and your biopsy results show the cancer has not spread within the breast tissue, the outlook (prognosis) is excellent. If the cancer has spread within the breast tissue (is invasive), the outlook is not as good, and the cancer will be staged8 and treated like any other invasive ductal carcinoma9.

Phyllodes tumors are most common in women in their 40s, but women of any age can have them. Women with Li-Fraumeni syndrome1 (a rare, inherited genetic condition) have an increased risk for phyllodes tumors. Diagnosis of phyllodes tumors Phyllodes tumors are usually felt as a firm, painless breast lump, but some may hurt. They tend to grow large fairly quickly, and they often stretch the skin. Sometimes these tumors are seen first on an imaging test (like an ultrasound2 or mammogram3), in which case they’re often hard to tell apart from fibroadenomas4. The diagnosis can often be made with a core needle biopsy5, but sometimes the entire tumor needs to be removed (during an excisional biopsy6) to know for sure that it’s a phyllodes tumor, and whether it's malignant or not. How do phyllodes tumors affect your risk for breast cancer? 38 _A_m__e_ri_ca_n_ _C_a_n_c_e_r_ S_o_c_i_e_ty_________________________________________c_a_n_c_e_r._o_rg_ _| _1_.8_0_0_._2_2_7_.2_3_4_5__ Having a benign phyllodes tumor does not affect your breast cancer risk. If you have a malignant phyllodes tumor, it does not affect your risk of getting other types of breast cancer. Still, you may be watched more closely and get regular imaging tests after treatment for a phyllodes tumor, because these tumors can sometimes come back after surgery. Treatment of phyllodes tumors Phyllodes tumors typically need to be removed completely with surgery. If the tumor is found to be benign, an excisional biopsy might be all that is needed, as long as the tumor was removed completely. If the tumor is borderline or malignant, a wider margin (area of normal tissue around the tumor) usually needs to be removed as well. This might be done with breast- conserving surgery7 (lumpectomy or partial mastectomy), in which part of the breast is removed. Or the entire breast might be removed with a mastectomy8, especially if a margin of normal breast tissue can't be taken out with breast-conserving surgery. Radiation therapy9 might be given to the area after surgery, especially if it’s not clear that all of the tumor was removed. Malignant phyllodes tumors are different from the more common types of breast cancer. They are less likely to respond to some of the treatments commonly used for breast cancer, such as the hormone therapy10 or chemotherapy11 drugs normally used for breast cancer. Phyllodes tumors that have spread to other parts of the body are often treated more like sarcomas12 (soft-tissue cancers) than breast cancers. Phyllodes tumors can sometimes come back in the same place. Because of this, close follow-up with frequent breast exams and imaging tests are usually recommended after treatment.

Last Revised: June 15, 2022 Key Statistics for Breast Cancer The information below is an overview of the latest statistics for breast cancer in women in the United States in 2025. How common is breast cancer? l Lifetime chance of getting breast cancer l Trends in breast cancer incidence l Trends in breast cancer deaths l Differences by race and ethnicity l Breast cancer survivors l How common is breast cancer? Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women in the United States, except for skin cancers. It accounts for about 30% (or 1 in 3) of all new female cancers each year. The American Cancer Society's estimates for breast cancer in the United States for 2025 are: 41 _A_m__e_ri_ca_n_ _C_a_n_c_e_r_ S_o_c_i_e_ty_________________________________________c_a_n_c_e_r._o_rg_ _| _1_.8_0_0_._2_2_7_.2_3_4_5__ About 316,950 new cases of invasive breast cancer will be diagnosed in women. l About 59,080 new cases of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) will be diagnosed. l About 42,170 women will die from breast cancer. l Breast cancer mainly occurs in middle-aged and older women. The median age at the time of breast cancer diagnosis is 62. This means half of the women who developed breast cancer are 62 years of age or younger when they are diagnosed. A very small number of women diagnosed with breast cancer are younger than 45. Lifetime chance of getting breast cancer Overall, the average risk of a woman in the United States developing breast cancer sometime in her life is about 13%. This means there is a 1 in 8 chance she will develop breast cancer. This also means there is a 7 in 8 chance she will never have the disease. Trends in breast cancer incidence In recent years, incidence rates have increased by 1% per year. The rise in incidence rates is a little steeper in women younger than 50 (1.4%). This is thought to be due to risk factors of having excess body weight, not having children, or having a first child after age 30. Trends in breast cancer deaths Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in women. (Only lung cancer kills more women each year.) The chance that any woman will die from breast cancer is about 1 in 43 (about 2.3%). Breast cancer death rates have been decreasing steadily since 1989, for an overall decline of 44% through 2022. The decrease in death rates is believed to be the result of finding breast cancer earlier through screening and increased awareness, as well as better treatments. Differences by race and ethnicity Some variations in breast cancer can be seen in racial and ethnic groups. For example: Black women have the highest death rate from breast cancer. This is thought to be l 42 _A_m__e_ri_ca_n_ _C_a_n_c_e_r_ S_o_c_i_e_ty_________________________________________c_a_n_c_e_r._o_rg_ _| _1_.8_0_0_._2_2_7_.2_3_4_5__ partially because Black women have a higher risk of triple-negative breast cancer, more than any other racial or ethnic group. At every age, Black women are more likely to die from breast cancer than any other l race or ethnic group. White, Asian, and Pacific Islander women are more likely to be diagnosed with l localized breast cancer than Black, Hispanic, American Indian, and Alaska Native women. Asian and Pacific Islander women have the lowest death rate from breast cancer. l Breast cancer survivors At this time there are more than 4 million breast cancer survivors in the United States. This includes women still being treated and those who have completed treatment. Survival rates are discussed in Survival Rates for Breast Cancer1.

Researchers around the world are working to find better ways to prevent, detect, and treat breast cancer, and to improve the quality of life of patients and survivors. Research studies l Breast cancer causes l Breast cancer prevention l New tests to personalize your treatment l New imaging tests l Breast cancer treatment l Supportive care l Research studies Current guidance on preventing and treating breast cancer as well as what might cause it (among other things) has come mainly from information discovered from research studies. Research studies can range from studies done in the lab to clinical trials done with hundreds of thousands of people. Clinical trials are carefully controlled studies that can gather specific information about certain diseases as well as explore promising new treatments. Clinical trials are one way to get the latest cancer treatments that are being investigated. Still, they are not right for everyone. If you would like to learn more about clinical trials that might be right for you, start by asking your doctor if your clinic or hospital conducts clinical trials, or see Clinical Trials1 to learn more. Breast cancer causes Studies continue to look at how certain lifestyle factors, habits, and other environmental 44 _A_m__e_ri_ca_n_ _C_a_n_c_e_r_ S_o_c_i_e_ty_________________________________________c_a_n_c_e_r._o_rg_ _| _1_.8_0_0_._2_2_7_.2_3_4_5__ factors, as well as inherited gene changes, might affect breast cancer risk. Here are a few examples: Several studies are looking at the effects of physical activity, weight gain or loss, l and diet on breast cancer risk. Some breast cancers run in families, but many of the gene mutations (changes) l that cause these breast cancers are not yet known. Research is being done to identify these gene changes. Several studies are focusing on the best use of genetic testing for inherited breast l cancer gene mutations. Scientists are exploring how common gene variants (small changes in genes that l are not as significant as mutations) may affect breast cancer risk. Gene variants typically have only a modest effect on risk by themselves, but when combined they could possibly have a large impact. Possible environmental causes of breast cancer have also received more attention l in recent years. While much of the science on this topic is still in its earliest stages, this is an area of active research. Breast cancer prevention Researchers are looking for ways to help reduce breast cancer risk, especially for women who are at high risk. Here are some examples: Studies continue to look at whether certain levels of physical activity, losing weight, l or eating certain foods, groups of foods, or types of diets might help lower breast cancer risk. Some hormonal medicines2 such as tamoxifen, raloxifene, exemestane, and l anastrozole have already been shown to help lower breast cancer risk for certain women at higher risk. Researchers continue to study which groups of women might benefit most from these drugs. Clinical trials are also looking at whether some non-hormonal drugs might lower l breast cancer risk, such as drugs used to treat blood or bone marrow disorders, like ruxolitinib. Studies are looking at vaccines that might help prevent certain types of breast l cancer in people who are at high risk for breast cancer (due to presence of hereditary gene mutations or breast cancer in the family). 45 _A_m__e_ri_ca_n_ _C_a_n_c_e_r_ S_o_c_i_e_ty_________________________________________c_a_n_c_e_r._o_rg_ _| _1_.8_0_0_._2_2_7_.2_3_4_5__ New tests to personalize your treatment Biomarkers Breast cancer tissue is routinely tested for the biomarkers ER3, PR4, and HER25 to help make treatment decisions. A biomarker6 is any gene, protein, or other substance that can be measured in blood, tissues, or other body fluids. Some studies are looking at whether testing for other biomarkers, such as HER3, might also be helpful, but research on this is still in early phases. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is DNA that is released into the bloodstream when cancer cells die. Identifying and testing the ctDNA in the blood for biomarkers is a rapidly growing area of study. Some ways ctDNA might potentially be used in breast cancer include: Looking for new biomarkers in the tumor cells that might mean the cancer has l become resistant to specific treatments (like chemo or targeted drug therapy) Determining if a certain drug will work on a tumor before trying it l Predicting if the breast cancer will recur (come back) in women with early-stage l breast cancer Predicting if neoadjuvant treatment is working to destroy the tumor instead of using l imaging tests like a CT scan or US Determining if breast cancer or a high-risk breast condition is present before l changes are found on an imaging test like a mammogram New imaging tests Newer types of tests are being developed for breast imaging. Some of these are already being used in certain situations, while others are still being studied. It will take time to see if they are as good as or better than those used today. Some of these tests include: Scintimammography (molecular breast imaging) l Positron emission mammography (PEM) l Electrical impedance imaging (EIT) l Elastography l New types of optical imaging tests l 46 _A_m__e_ri_ca_n_ _C_a_n_c_e_r_ S_o_c_i_e_ty_________________________________________c_a_n_c_e_r._o_rg_ _| _1_.8_0_0_._2_2_7_.2_3_4_5__ For more on these tests, see Newer and Experimental Breast Imaging Tests7. Breast cancer treatment New kinds of treatments for breast cancer are always being studied. For example, in recent years, several new targeted drugs8 have been approved to treat breast cancer. More and better treatment options are needed, especially for cancers like triple-negative breast cancer, where chemotherapy is the main option. Some areas of research involving breast cancer treatment include: Treating patients who have hormone-positive and HER2 negative advanced breast l cancer with a drug that targets the estrogen receptor (ie. camizestrant) if tumor cells were to who develop an ESR1 mutation. Studying if shorter courses of radiation therapy for very early-stage breast cancers l are at least as good as the longer courses now often used Testing if different types of radiation therapy, such as proton beam radiation, might l be better than standard radiation. Combining certain drugs (like 2 targeted drugs, a targeted drug with an l immunotherapy drug, or a hormone drug with a targeted drug) to see if they work better together Trying to find new drugs or drug combinations that might help treat breast cancer l that has spread to the brain Testing different immunotherapy drugs to treat triple-negative breast cancer l Giving cancer vaccines to see if this helps keep the cancer from either worsening or l coming back after treatment. There are many ways in which cancer vaccines work. For example, protein vaccines stimulate the immune system to recognize and attack specific cancer proteins. DNA vaccines contain DNA instructions so that once the vaccine is given, the DNA will instruct your body to make protein(s) to help the immune system recognize and attack cancer cells. Finding new ways to treat women with hereditary breast cancer, since they have a l higher chance of the cancer recurring (coming back) Determining if chemotherapy is needed to treat every woman with HER2-positive l breast cancer Finding new treatment options when breast cancer becomes resistant to current l treatments 47 _A_m__e_ri_ca_n_ _C_a_n_c_e_r_ S_o_c_i_e_ty_________________________________________c_a_n_c_e_r._o_rg_ _| _1_.8_0_0_._2_2_7_.2_3_4_5__ Supportive care Supportive care helps patients and caregivers manage the symptoms of cancer and side effects of cancer treatment. Clinical trials are looking at different medicines and techniques to try to improve supportive care for people with breast cancer. For example, some studies are investigating: If there are better medicines or ways to prevent the damage to nerves9 that l sometimes happen with certain chemotherapy drugs If drugs or other treatments might be helpful in limiting memory problems and l other brain symptoms after chemotherapy10 If certain heart or blood pressure drugs, can help prevent the heart damage l sometimes caused by common breast cancer drugs such as doxorubicin and trastuzumab If there are medicines that might be able to help treat the tired feeling that cancer l can cause Breast Cancer Research Highlights 11 The Society's research program has played a crucial role in saving lives from breast cancer.

Breast-cancer five-year survival rates in high-income countries exceed 90%, compared with 66% in India and 40% in South Africa. The WHO Global Breast Cancer Initiative (GBCI), established in 2021, has set the goal to reduce breast cancer mortality by 2.5% per year, which over a 20-year period would save 2.5 million lives. This GBCI Implementation Framework provides national programme managers, policy makers and multisectoral actors the guidance needed to assess, strengthen and scale-up services for the early detection and management of breast cancer. The Framework presents key strategies using three pillars: • Pillar 1. Health promotion for early detection (prevention and pre-diagnostic interval) • Pillar 2. Timely breast diagnostics (diagnostic interval) • Pillar 3. Comprehensive breast-cancer management (treatment interval). Implementation strategies are specified, which include how governments can operationalize this Framework to improve access to breast-cancer services in their settings. Using this Framework, all stakeholders can achieve the Initiative’s goal to assure feasibility and quality by providing evidence-based recommendations for a phased approach to implementing interventions and strengthen health systems towards the attainment of universal health coverage.

We have the tools and the know-how to prevent breast cancer and save lives. Countries with strong health systems have reduced breast cancer mortality by 40% since 1990. This shows the need for strategic investments in health systems founded on established principles of health promotion for early detection, timely diagnosis, and access to comprehensive management as part of universal health coverage. The Framework of the Global Breast Cancer Initiative lays out a roadmap for immediately implementable strategies for countries with diverse health systems.

UHC universal health coverage xi Glossary of terms Age-standardized mortality rates An age-standardized mortality rate is the weighted average of the age-specific mortality rates per 100 000 population , where the weights represent the proportions of people in the corresponding age-groups of the WHO standard population. Benefit-to-cost ratio1 This is the ratio of project benefits to project costs. It involves adding up the total discounted benefits gained by a project over its entire duration/life span and dividing it over the total discounted costs of the project 1. [Σ B/ (1+d)i] BCR = i added up over 1 = 0 to n years [ΣC / (1+d)i] i Where: Bi = the project’s benefit in year i, where i = 0 to n years Ci = the project’s costs in year i, where i = 0 to n years, n = the total number of years of project duration/life span, d = the discount rate. Breast-cancer-control programmes A breast-cancer prevention-and-control programme comprises an organized set of activities aimed at preventing and reducing morbidity and mortality from breast cancer. A comprehensive programme includes a plan of action specifying the work to be done, those responsible, timelines, and resources for implementation. In addition, it describes the evidence-based interventions needed to reduce the high and unequal burden that breast cancer imposes on women and health systems in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Breast self-examination (BSE) BSE is a visual and tactile examination of the breast performed by the individual to assess the presence of persistent changes or abnormalities, thereby helping the individual learn over time what looks and feels normal for her. During a BSE, the individual inspects her breasts in the mirror, looking for asymmetries, puckering, dimpling, or localized skin changes, then feels the entire breast and armpits with the arm and shoulder extended to flatten the breast on the chest wall. Clinical breast assessment (CBA) CBA refers to the set of clinical tools essential for the early diagnosis of breast cancer at the primary-care level. To conduct a CBA, a provider takes a medical history to learn what changes (if any) the patient has noted in the breast, such as lumps, thickenings, asymmetries, or skin changes, as well as the time course over which these changes have occurred. The provider then performs a general medical examination, including a clinical breast examination (CBE) (see below) to correlate the historical findings with those present on physical examination. The findings of the CBA are used by the clinician to formulate a differential diagnosis, request diagnostic imaging, and determine if tissue sampling (biopsy) is warranted. 1 Pan American Health Organization, WHO Regional Office for the Americas. Smart hospitals toolkit. Washington, DC: Pan American Health Organization; (https:// www.paho.org/disasters/dmdocuments/SmartHospitalsToolkit.pdf, accessed 15 February 2023). xii Clinical breast examination (CBE) CBE is a systematic and specific clinical examination of the breast, the nipples, and the areola, axillary, infraclavicular and supraclavicular lymph nodes, performed by a health-care provider. Abnormal findings on CBE generally warrant diagnostic imaging and may require tissue sampling to make a definitive diagnosis. CBE, which is required for CBA, is performed in conjunction with breast-cancer early-diagnosis programmes and can be deployed as part of a breast-cancer screening programme. Clinical (care) process Clinical processes or clinical-care processes encompass all health-care provider activities and other prescribed health-care activities that are implemented to address identified or specified health issues. These involve the GBCI Breast Cancer Care Pathway, which is a series of clinical-care processes grouped into three sequential intervals (pre-diagnostic, diagnostic and treatment) in alignment with the three GBCI Pillars to facilitate early detection, diagnosis and management of breast abnormalities and cancers. Early detection Early detection is the overall process whereby breast cancer is detected at earlier stages (0, I or II) when treatment is on average more effective. Early detection requires “early-diagnosis” approaches among the general population and may include “screening” a prespecified subgroup of individuals without breast symptoms. Both early diagnosis and screening programmes achieve “stage shifting” in which a greater fraction of breast cancers in the population is diagnosed at earlier stages of disease progression. The goal of an early detection breast-cancer programme is to promote stage shifting so that >60% of women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer have stages I or II disease. Early diagnosis programme Breast cancer early-diagnosis programmes are the initial step in establishing a breast-cancer early-detection programme. To facilitate breast cancer early diagnosis, individuals with early, subtle symptoms of breast cancer are encouraged to seek care and undergo evaluation and definitive diagnostic work-ups (imaging +/- tissue sampling) to determine which individuals have cancer and which do not. Distinct from screening programmes of women without symptoms, where testing is limited to a prespecified age group at heightened risk of breast cancer, all individuals with breast-cancer symptoms warrant evaluation, regardless of age. The goal of early-diagnosis programmes is to implement clinical approaches so that >60% of women found to have invasive breast cancer have stages I or II disease. Mammogram A mammogram is an X-ray examination (radiogram) of the breast, including multiple views of one or both breasts. It is used to detect and diagnose breast disease in women who have breast problems, such as a lump, pain, or nipple discharge (diagnostic mammogram), and in women with no breast complaints (screening mammogram). Mammography Mammography comprises the radiology and diagnostic-imaging services that are devoted to the practice of mammography. It involves a combination of equipment and human resources aimed at applying low- energy X-rays to the examination of breasts. Regardless of whether mammography is used for screening or diagnostic purposes, a quality-assurance programme is required to maximize the benefits and minimize the harms associated with this procedure. Metastatic breast cancer (MBC) MBC refers to the spread of the primary breast tumour from the breast through the circulation and lymphatics to distant sites and organs, most often bone, lung, liver and brain. Advanced breast cancers (ABCs) may initially present with distant metastases (MBC stage IV) or may recur with distant metastases following initial treatment (metastatic recurrence of stages I – III disease). xiii Monitoring This involves the systematic collection of data for measuring the achievements of breast-cancer-control programmes, which are assessed periodically, using a set of measurable indicators. Multimodality treatment Multimodality treatment is prescribed for patients on an individualized basis, utilizing multiple modes of therapy (surgery, radiation therapy, anti-cancer medication) to minimize the risk of cancer recurrence. Specific treatment programmes are determined in alignment with evidence-based cancer guidelines, based on the cancer’s biological features and the extent and stage of the disease. Screening programme A breast-cancer-screening programme is a public health, early-detection approach whereby women without known signs or symptoms of breast cancer are invited, on a repetitive basis, to undergo testing for cancer before it causes recognizable signs or symptoms. To consistently find cancer at early stages of the disease, the screening test must be repeated in the same individuals at regular intervals (every 1–2 years). To avoid excessively high numbers of false-positive test results, the subgroup of individuals invited for screening should be limited to those whose degree of breast-cancer risk exceeds a prespecified risk threshold. Screening-selection criteria are based primarily on age and gender and secondarily on other recognized risk factors, including genetic or familial risk, reproductive history and breast density. Stage shifting This is the shifting at diagnosis from one stage to the stage below, or the diagnosis of cancer earlier in the stage. This is often a result of early-detection programmes. Systemic (anti-cancer medicine) therapy/treatment Systemic anti-cancer therapies are a group of medicines prescribed to kill cancer cells that have spread beyond the primary tumour. Standardized multi-medication treatment regimens are individually prescribed based on breast-cancer subtyping as determined by tumour-marker testing (ER, PR and HER2 expression) and may include cytotoxics/chemotherapy, endocrine (hormonal) treatments, and/or targeted (or biological) therapies. Systemic therapy is given in conjunction with other therapeutic interventions to control disease in the breast and lymph-node beds (surgery and radiotherapy). Systemic anti-cancer therapies can be administered following (adjuvant) or prior to (neoadjuvant) surgical resection of the primary breast tumour. Supportive services Supportive services are an essential component of cancer management for patients at all stages of the disease, including the management of physical symptoms resulting from cancer and its treatment (pain, nausea, hair loss, fatigue, lymphedema), some of which can be long-lasting. Supportive services also address the psychosocial and spiritual challenges that cancer and its treatments can trigger (anxiety, depression, feelings of social isolation). Treatment completion Treatment completion means the fulfilment of all components or steps of the therapeutic sequence, unless interruption is indicated for medical reasons. Treatment abandonment Treatment abandonment refers to the failure to complete the treatment regimen for reasons other than medical indications for treatment disruption. xiv Executive summary Breast cancer from the global health perspective What is breast cancer?

To improve aimed at reducing global breast-cancer mortality existing health-care delivery systems, it is necessary in LMICs, WHO established the Global Breast Cancer to monitor programmatic inputs, outputs, and Initiative (GBCI) in 2021. The goal of the Initiative is outcomes to determine possible gaps in care to provide evidence-based recommendations for delivery. Three evidence-based key performance a phased approach to implementing interventions indicators (KPIs) have been proposed to identify focused on improving early detection, diagnosis, system gaps that may exist. GBCI has established the following three pillars towards achieving its primary objective. Pillar 1 Health promotion for early detection (pre-diagnostic interval) KPI: >60% of invasive cancers are stage I or II at diagnosis Pillar 2 Timely breast diagnostics (diagnostic interval) KPI: diagnostic evaluation, imaging, tissue sampling and pathology within 60 days Pillar 3 Comprehensive breast-cancer management (treatment interval) KPI: >80% undergo multimodality treatment without abandonment xvii Pillar 1 Health promotion for early detection Breast-cancer risk factors include inherited high- to focus on the development of functional, resource- risk gene mutations, such as BRCA1 and BRCA2, but appropriate early-detection programmes. these inherited mutations only explain 10–20% of breast cancers at the population level.

Breast cancer is a malignant growth that arises can progress and invade the surrounding breast in the ducts (85%) or lobules (15%) of the breast tissue (invasive breast cancer). Invasive cancers gland. Initially, the cancerous growth is confined have the potential to spread to the nearby lymph to the duct (in situ) where, generally, it causes no nodes (regional metastasis) or to other organs in symptoms and has minimal potential for distant the body (distant metastasis). Reducing the fraction spread (metastasis) through the lymphatics to of patients presenting with distant metastasis is the lymph nodes, or through the blood to distant essential to improving breast-cancer survival rates organs (most commonly the lung, liver, bones, or at the population level. brain).

GBCI recommendations The GBCI recommendations are intended for dissemination to a broad target audience, including ministries of health, other governmental and allied policy-makers, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) (including professional organizations, researchers and the academic community), and programme managers. They represent a call for action to each of the allies regarding the development of implementation projects in a variety of settings globally (with an emphasis on LMICs), and in underrepresented and under-resourced communities in HICs (5). The GBCI approach for improving global breast- of surgery, radiotherapy, and systemic treatment cancer outcomes is to leverage what has been (cancer-directed medicines) that, together with learned in HICs about effective breast-cancer supportive-care medicines and services, make the prevention, detection, and management completion of treatment regimens possible.

The three pillars of the breast-cancer patient-care pathway summarize complex information, establishing a common needs-based understanding and integrated approach for all stakeholders working to improve breast-cancer outcomes (Box 4) (5). Box 4. The three-pillar framework of the breast-cancer patient-care pathway This framework requires: policy-makers to assess policies related to health- system strengthening and determine any gaps, based on clinical targets and goals; health-care administrators to recognize system gaps for which they need resources and personnel to perform required tasks within appropriate timeframes; clinicians to define and explain the services they need to diagnose and manage breast cancer in their settings; community-based organizations and patient and advocacy groups to define the services they require to improve outcomes at the patient, family and community levels, and to frame advocacy messages (5). 14 Pillar 1 The pre-diagnostic interval GBCI defines the pre-diagnostic interval as the programmes integral components of Pillar 1 before period that begins when the patient first presents the start of the pre-diagnostic interval (5) . to the health-care system for an evaluation of a breast complaint and/or seeks to participate in An individual with symptomatic breast cancer can breast-cancer early-detection programmes and navigate through the local health-care system in a ends with referral for diagnostic evaluation of variety of ways before receiving a clinical evaluation possible breast abnormalities.

Three evidence-based key performance indicators (KPIs) have been proposed to identify where these may exist (Table 1). Table 1.

In years six to fifteen, Kenya plans to establish Kenya model for early detection proposes a screening programmes based on a combination of 15-year implementation plan, using a phased CBE-led screening and MG-led screening, utilizing implementation approach (Box 6, Fig, 6A) and the infrastructure and programming established examines outcomes projected to 15-years (Fig. 6A, during the first five years. The following predictions Table 1A) and 40-years (Fig. 6B, Table 1B) (12). and cost estimates were projected, using the Kenya model and based on the Kenya-specific baseline During the first five years, health-system data collected through an initial (current status) strengthening focuses on: (i) the establishment of situation assessment. diagnostic services to work-up clinically detectable Box 6. The Kenya model for early detection The Kenya model for early detection launched in 2022 includes: creation of demand (awareness campaigns through traditional and social media, advocated by community, religious and other leaders); training (of health workers to increase breast-cancer awareness, the use of CBE, and of imaging, laboratory and health-records personnel); service delivery (eight breast-cancer centres of excellence have been established, imaging services have been set up in 47 counties, and quality pathology services and strong linkage and referral structures are in place); monitoring and evaluation (paced, planned assessments) (12). 20 Treatment Short-term The total cost of treating breast cancer will increase (5-year) outcomes because more breast-cancer cases will be diagnosed and treated (Table 1A). However, the average treatment costs per person will decrease because Cancer stage more early-stage cases, requiring less-intensive During the first phase of the Kenya model, when forms of therapy, will be identified. early diagnosis systems are established prior to the introduction of screening, stage shifting is predicted Mortality reduction to occur where the fraction of patients diagnosed Breast-cancer survival rates improve as late- with invasive breast-cancer disease stages I and stage diagnoses decrease and more women II is estimated to increase from 31% prior to receive treatment for breast cancer in the early implementation (current state) to 50% at five years stages (Fig. 6B).

The pre-diagnostic interval Key messages from this chapter What is breast cancer? Health promotion for early detection focuses on improving the understanding of the public and health-care professionals of breast-cancer risk factors and symptoms. Health promotion for early detection focuses on improving the understanding of the public and health-care professionals of breast-cancer risk factors and symptoms. Early detection is founded on breast-health awareness as part of early-diagnosis programmes. These programmes focus on identifying people with signs and symptoms suggesting malignancy and facilitating access to cancer diagnostic services. All health- care systems require the capacity to diagnose symptomatic breast complaints, such as lumps, thickenings, or other clinically detectable abnormalities. Breast-cancer screening (an alternate early-detection programmatic strategy in which women in a target age group are invited to undergo testing yearly or every other year) may be an aspirational goal once health-system prerequisites have been established. However, organized, population-based screening is not an appropriate or practical initial step in any setting until the required infrastructure and quality-control measures are in place and fully functional. The KPI for Pillar 1 is >60% of invasive cancers to be stage I or II at diagnosis. No country has achieved a sustained decline in breast-cancer mortality rates of 2% per year or more for at least three consecutive years without also achieving a level of early detection where 60% of patients present with stage I or II disease. ©WHO/Benjamin Anderson 26 The pre-diagnostic interval (Pillar 1) represents the period before an individual presents to the health-care system with a breast complaint, or for breast screening. This includes individuals with abnormal clinical or radiographic findings who are referred for diagnostic work-up (Pillar 2) (Fig. 7). Fig. 7.

Personalized assessment of risk for breast-cancer Known breast-cancer risk factors include genetic mutations, previous exposure to thoracic radiation, older age, obesity, breast density, and a family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer. Individuals found to be at increased risk for breast cancer (>20% overall lifetime risk) are candidates for enhanced screening in settings where screening is available and sustainable. Breast-cancer risk calculators (with strengths, weaknesses and variable efficiency and accuracy impacts) are available for use in the primary-care setting. Two commonly used risk calculators are the Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool designed by National Cancer Institute (USA) (16) and the Tyrer-Cuzick Risk Model (17). Their usefulness to LMICs is unknown, especially in settings where screening services are unavailable (18). ©WHO/Benjamin Anderson ©WHO/Benjamin Anderson 30 Breast-cancer risk reduction Public education to reduce risk In the European Union, levels of alcohol consumption Education about risk factors is a core component of described as “light to moderate” (<20g of pure programmes on breast-cancer awareness. The aim alcohol per day) caused almost 23 000 new cancer is to positively influence the health behaviour of cases in 2017, accounting for 13.3% of all alcohol- individuals within communities, as well as to provide attributable cancers, and 2.3% of all cases of the guidance on how living and working conditions can seven alcohol-related cancer types, including negatively influence their health. oesophagus, liver, colorectal, oral cancers, and breast cancers.

Cohort studies have shown was responsible for 5.1% of the global burden that even drinking only 1 g of total alcohol per day of disease and injury (19,20). The prevalence of increases the risk, particularly in postmenopausal alcohol consumption in women aged 15+ varies women. No “safe” amount of alcohol consumption by WHO region, ranging from 4.3 litres per capita relative to cancer and health can be established. in the European Region in 2019 to 0.1 litres per capita in the Eastern Mediterranean Region.

In 2018, the proportions of breast-cancer risk, may benefit from specific risk-reduction interventions. The timely identification of increased risk attributed to alcohol consumption in Asia, breast-cancer risk in an individual is key to proposing North America and Europe were 11.5%, 13.0%, and enabling the appropriate use of risk-reducing and 20.6%, respectively (22). Compared with non- interventions. The two main interventions available drinkers, women who drink have an increased to date are: (i) pharmacological therapy, also called risk of breast cancer: 21% higher for hormone- chemoprevention (e.g., selective estrogen-receptor receptor-negative breast cancers and 40% higher modulators (SERMs) or aromatase inhibitors (Ais)); for hormone-receptor-positive breast cancers (22). and (ii) risk-reducing prophylactic surgery. 31 Early-detection programmes The goal of an early-detection breast-cancer possible malignancy, and linking them to diagnostic programme is to develop and implement strategies services for the correct identification of those with for diagnosing >60% of women with early-stage cancer. Breast-cancer screening, in which women disease (stages I or II) to improve breast-cancer in a target age-group, without recognized signs or outcomes. In settings where late-stage breast-cancer symptoms of breast cancer, are invited to undergo presentation is common, and women present with testing yearly or every other year, may be an cancers that are easily felt or seen, stage shifting aspirational goal once health-system prerequisites will be required to increase the fraction of patients have been established. However, screening is not an initially diagnosed with early-stage disease. Early appropriate or practical initial step until the required detection begins with breast-health awareness and infrastructure and quality-control measures are the establishment of early-diagnosis programmes, in place and have been demonstrated to be fully which focus on identifying people with signs and functional at a clinical level (24). symptoms of breast cancer (Box 8), suggesting Box 8. Breast-cancer signs and symptoms These can vary significantly and may include: a painless breast mass or thickening thickening, redness or warmth of the skin, or a rash enlarged lymph nodes in the armpit(s) focal (rather than generalized) breast pain nipple discharge or progressive nipple inversion. Most breast lumps are benign and most breast symptoms are NOT caused by cancer, which is why a diagnostic work-up is required to identify who has cancer and who does not. 32 Early-detection strategies: breast- Breast-health awareness can help people health awareness overcome the fear, misinformation or stigma associated with cancer. At the individual-level, Successful early-detection programmes include it should translate into appropriate breast-health spreading breast-health awareness among behaviour. At the public level, communities the public. Overall, the goal of breast-health should engage community health workers (CHWs), awareness is to improve knowledge about breast along with religious and traditional leaders, to cancer in target populations. The development work with medical teams in developing breast- and implementation of breast-cancer awareness health-awareness campaigns.

Civil-society organizations (CSOs) can play a significant role At the individual-level, people must be aware of in extending the reach of community education specific cancer symptoms. To recognize these, and awareness. When engaging CHWs (and CSOs) in people must know how to conduct a baseline raising awareness, it is essential that they receive the breast self-examination (BSE). They should be support of the health-care system. For example, it is taught the importance of promptly reporting any important that primary-health-care facilities work changes to a health-care worker or health provider with CHWs and CSOs on ensuring the availability of (Box 9). In unscreened populations, such as in affordable and convenient facilities where patients northern Peru, women self-discover their breast can be evaluated in a timely fashion and informed cancers in over 90% of cases (25). BSE is a valuable of any need for follow-up. Engaging breast-cancer tool for awareness education and should not be survivors in sharing their personal experiences is discouraged (Fig. 9). also a powerful tool for raising awareness (26). Fig. 9. Sample BSE technique 33 Box 9. The role of BSE in the early detection of breast cancer BSE is an examination performed by the individual, which includes inspecting the breast in the mirror and feeling the entire breast and armpits, the arm in use being extended to flatten the breast on the chest wall. BSE plays a key role in breast-health awareness by helping the individual to know what feels normal. This is a prerequisite for being able to assess where new findings, such as lumps, thickenings, or other persistent changes might represent abnormalities. While BSE has not been found to improve breast-cancer detection among women who undergo routine mammographic screening, over 90% of breast cancers are self-detected in those who do not. A randomized study of BSE in Shanghai, China, did not show an improvement in breast-cancer survival in women who had been formally trained in BSE versus those who had not. However, it did show that those in the untrained (control) group were already good at identifying small cancers (less than 2cm) (27). Breast health awareness should continue to be encouraged. Women who through BSE identify persistent findings that feel abnormal should be supported in seeking diagnostic work-ups. Clinicians should pay attention to self-identified breast abnormalities and recommend diagnostic work-ups, even if CBE does not reveal what a women describes she feels in her breast and with her fingers (28). 34 Early detection: clinical breast- Referral for definitive diagnosis assessment skills Well-functioning referral networks and patient navigation are required so that people with breast The clinical tools essential for the early diagnosis of abnormalities can receive prompt, accurate and breast cancer at the primary-care level are history- definitive diagnoses (Pillar 2). taking skills and the ability to perform a CBA.

Virtual or live workshops with with public breast-cancer awareness education real or simulated patients can teach providers so that individuals with signs and/or symptoms how to take an accurate clinical breast history and of possible breast cancer present themselves for perform physical examinations. It is important to CBA and diagnostic work-up. Organized at the ask the women if they had noted any abnormalities population level, early-diagnosis programmes focus in their breasts and if so, to point out in which way on identifying individuals with signs and symptoms they had found the workshops to be helpful in suggesting possible breast malignancy and linking this connection. those individuals to diagnostic services for the correct cancer diagnosis. Performing a CBE CBE is a systematic and specific examination From a health-system perspective, early of the breasts, nipples, and areolas combined diagnosis is not an alternative to screening – it with examination of axillary, infraclavicular and is a prerequisite.

Although live or virtual workshops (including real patients, simulation-based methodologies, or videos) do have an impact, education in examining real patients is ultimately required to ensure quality of skills in this area (28). 35 Box 10. The role of CBE in the early detection of breast cancer CBE is required for CBA if the clinician can correlate the findings from the patient’s history, BSE, and diagnostic imaging to formulate a differential diagnosis and determine a diagnostic plan for a given breast abnormality. The goal of breast-cancer early-diagnosis programmes is to correctly diagnose breast cancers early in their course when the signs and symptoms of disease can be subtle. Thus, CBE is the cornerstone for evaluating breast findings in patients who present with self-appreciated breast complaints that could represent cancer. CBE has not been shown to improve breast-cancer early detection when used in conjunction with mammographic screening. However, CBE has been successfully used as a screening test in previously unscreened populations and has been shown to promote favourable stage shifting (29). One study demonstrated a survival benefit in women aged 50 years and older (30). Box 11. What is the evidence of a stage- shifting threshold in breast cancer? IHO performed a population-based analysis to determine the degree of early-stage diagnosis associated with improved breast-cancer survival at the national level. Among 35 countries with adequate breast-cancer TNM-stage distribution data and longitudinal survival data by year, 20 had achieved sustained reductions in breast-cancer mortality (>2% annual mortality reduction for three consecutive years); 15 had not. In each of the 20 countries that had achieved sustained reductions in breast-cancer mortality, at least 60% of patients with invasive breast-cancer presented as stages I or II disease. Some of these countries had population-based mammographic screening programmes. 36 Early detection: screening costly approach whereby women from a target In addition to early diagnosis, screening is a tool age-group, with no known signs or symptoms of that promotes favourable stage shifting, but breast cancer, are invited to undergo a screening these detection methods differ in resource and test.

In most LMICs, over 90% in well-resourced settings. Randomized trials have of breast cancers are found initially by the women demonstrated that mammographic screening of themselves (25). Thus, all health-care systems women aged 50–69 years can reduce breast-cancer require the capacity to diagnose symptomatic mortality by 23% (Fig. 11).

Women with demonstrated successful stage shifting (where the these symptoms first present for evaluation disease distribution weighed more heavily towards outside screening programmes, either because early-stage disease).

The decision to start a mammographic screening programme is a nuanced one that each country must base on an individualized strategic assessment. In appropriately selected countries, it may be necessary to begin screening in urban areas, and subsequently extend it to rural areas where access is more limited. Having accessible diagnostic imaging and tissue-sampling services (breast ultrasound, diagnostic MG, needle biopsy) in place is mandatory before any breast-cancer-screening efforts can be contemplated (GBCI Pillar 2). Mammographic-screening programmes are highly resource intensive regarding both initiation and sustainment. Beyond the purchase of MG machines, running effective screening programmes requires a trained workforce, quality-control systems, and data-management systems to keep a track of the patients through repeated mammographic studies over time. A screen-detected cancer is one that was not seen on a prior mammogram but has become apparent on a current mammogram. Thus, to achieve stage shifting, mammographic screening requires that studies of the same women in the target group be repeated every 1–2 years. When the majority of breast-cancer patients present with locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) or metastatic breast cancer (MBC) that can be detected through CBE, the focus needs to be on establishing early-diagnosis programmes. This will promote favourable stage shifting at a significantly lower cost (24,34). 40 A general consensus on population-based screening cancer in LMICs could mask the potential survival programmes, using CBE in a target population, benefits resulting from clinically driven stage particularly in settings where mammographic shifting. By contrast, one subsequently published screening programmes are not feasible, has not yet prospective randomized control trial conducted in been achieved. A systematic review of 11 analyses Mumbai, India, demonstrated that it is possible to published between 1993 and 2019 found evidence surpass the 60% threshold of diagnosing people that CBE contributes between 17% and 47% with stages I or II disease through improved clinical of stage shifting from advanced to early-stage detection in the absence of mammographic disease (35). This review did not provide direct screening. Notably, the Mumbai trial did observe evidence of mortality benefit from the use of CBE a breast-cancer-mortality reduction of nearly 30% screening, but did note that the inaccessibility among women aged >50 (Fig. 12) (30). and/or unaffordability of treatments for late-stage Fig. 12.

The diagnostic interval Key messages from this chapter What is breast cancer? Timely breast diagnostics require a series of coordinated services for definitive cancer diagnosis and staging. The diagnostic interval represents the intermediate period between referral for a diagnostic work-up and the time that a definitive benign or malignant diagnosis is made. Delays from first presentation to the health-care system to breast-cancer diagnosis (diagnostic-interval delays) are associated with a greater likelihoPIoLdLA oRf 1late-stage diagnosis and lower chance of breast-cancer survival. Interventions to promote timely breast diagnostics include organizing services to increase access. If it is not feasible to fully decentralize imaging and pathology services, well-organized sample-transport systems and information systems can effectively decentralize sample collections, while minimizing patient travel and still enabling critical results to be obtained in a reasonable timeframe. The KPI for Pillar 2 is for breast cancers to be diagnosed within 60 days (two months) of initial presentation to a health-care system. ©WHO/Benjamin Anderson 44 The diagnostic interval (Pillar 2) represents the intermediate period between referral for a diagnostic work-up and the time that a definitive benign or malignant diagnosis is made. Those found to have cancer then need to be referred for definitive treatment (Pillar 3) (Fig. 13). Fig. 13.

How often are benign breast- cancer diagnostic work-ups conducted in unscreened populations? Among 7573 previously unexamined women in rural Ethiopia who underwent CBE: 258 (3.4%) complained of a breast problem 49 (19%) were eligible for a needle biopsy 5 (10.2%) were diagnosed with cancer The resulting prevalence in this rural community was in line with the data from the population-based cancer registry in the urban context (which accounts for the small sample) (37). 46 Pathology and biomarker testing For a specific breast tumour, pathology laboratories Skilled pathologists, laboratory technicians and provide the definitive tissue diagnosis (malignant diagnostic equipment are often in short supply, and versus benign) that is required to determine centralized testing may not be available to serve an if and what type of cancer treatment is required. entire region or country adequately or efficiently.

Box 14. Pathology laboratory services A laboratory serving a catchment population of 1 million people should process 10 000 specimens per year (40 samples per working day) to efficiently utilize its resources, including tissue-processing equipment, consumables, and technical staff. To achieve this level of centralization, pathology laboratories need to plan strategically to ensure the transportation of an appropriate number of specimens to the facility to meet this benchmark (39). ©WHO/Benjamin Anderson 47 Centralization versus decentralization of diagnostic services Breast diagnostic services (complete clinical lower costs, without compromising quality.

Centralization versus decentralization of breast-health services a q Box 15. Co-localization of imaging and pathology services Triple-test evaluation requires the comparison of clinical examinations, imaging, and pathology findings to determine whether the separate test results correlate (are concordant) or conflict (are discordant) with each other. Discordant findings can be a reason to repeat tissue sampling. High-quality diagnostic services require the radiology and pathology teams to compare each other’s findings to assess how well the imaging level of suspicion is reflected in the actual pathology (concordant versus discordant). The consolidation and coordination of imaging and pathology services into commonly accessible centres can optimize diagnostic quality. 49 Cancer staging Once a cancer diagnosis has been confirmed, AJCC/UICC TNM anatomic staging the patient should undergo staging to evaluate The anatomic staging of breast cancer considers the extent of disease. Accurate staging is essential tumour size (T), nodal status (N) and metastasis to guiding treatment. Staging is based on clinical (M) (Fig. 15).

It also illustrates access Prognostic staging takes anatomic staging into to quality services that allow timely diagnosis and consideration, but also stratifies by biological referral for initiation of treatment. Delays between factors, such as tumour grade, proliferation rate, the identification of symptoms and the start of ER and PR expression, human-epidermal-growth- treatment have been associated with more factor-2 (HER2) expression, and gene-expression advanced stages of disease at diagnosis and prognostic panels (44).

Despite the ample use of the TNM staging system in clinical Essential TNM care, cancer registries, especially those in LMICs, Despite the importance of cancer staging for still face important challenges to collecting these population-based cancer registries, such data are data for all cancer patients. In LMICs, this translates often incomplete, or too complex to be collected into registries having limited data on breast-cancer from medical records. To overcome these barriers, stages and, thus, a limited means of comparability. simplified staging systems, such as the Essential For this reason, use of the Essential TNM Staging TNM tool, have been developed. Cancer registrars System (42) has been proposed, as a minimum, can use Essential TNM when the individual elements to allow population registries to provide staging for standard TNM staging have not been accurately information when full information on the TNM stage recorded. Essential TNM is composed of three key is missing. elements that together summarize the extent of cancer in the patient: M – the presence or absence of distant metastasis; N – the presence or absence of regional node metastasis/involvement; and T – the extent of invasion and/or size of the tumour (42). 50 Fig. 15a.

Successful systemic-therapy programmes for breast cancer The choice of systemic therapy for breast cancer is based on the following: These include: medical oncologists who can prescribe systemic therapy, manage toxicity and monitor efficacy; trained nurses who can administer systemic therapy and help in the monitoring and evaluation of toxicity; trained pharmacists; access to 24-hour care in emergencies; protocols on the preparation for, and the safe handling and administration of, chemotherapy; annual (at a minimum) quantification of medicines and volumes; procurement mechanisms to avoid stockouts and make full use of generic manufacturers, as appropriate, to reduce costs; access to supportive-care medicines for the prevention and management of toxicities; tumour biology, mainly breast-cancer subtype (ER, PR and HER2-receptor status plus additional factors, such as histological type, tumor grade, proliferation marker and lympho-vascular invasion, and genomic scores to guide Evidence-basseysdtem ciac tnrecatemre-ntt,r seucaht ams Oencnottyp geDuxi);d elines tumour burden, determined by the TNM stage (tumour size, axillary-lymph-node involvement, the presence/absence of distant metastases): patient characteristics, including age, performance status, comorbidities, and patient preferences. 62 Evidence-based cancer-treatment need for them to be contextually adapted. However, guidelines a few of them do provide resource-stratified High-quality evidence-based guidelines for breast- guidance on improving breast-cancer survival in cancer treatment provide a framework for treatment LMICs (54).

Examples of high-quality evidence-based control planning, it is critical to assess and monitor guidelines for the provision of multimodality the level of adherence to evidence-based guidelines treatment regimens include those provided by and the ability of the health-care system to deliver the National Comprehensive Cancer Network the care recommended in a timely fashion (Box 20). (NCCN) (51), the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) (52) and the American Society In addition to treatment guidelines, there are of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) (53) (Table 3). Such various resources available, published by several guidelines largely agree on treatment sequencing organizations, which provide standards to guide the and preferred regimens, but almost all have been development of breast-cancer centres with a focus developed based on high-resource settings and the on optimizing multidisciplinary care (55,56). Box 20. Why are cancer-management guidelines important? Providing access to standardized guideline-based management is necessary to improve guideline compliance and reduce breast-cancer mortality. Cancer guidelines can only help improve cancer outcomes if the care described in the guidelines can be delivered to completion without significant interruption. High-quality, evidence-based guidelines are available from HICs, but generally need to be adapted to existing services and resources. Guideline adaptation to existing services and affordable care (resource stratification) is necessary in resource-constrained settings to ensure sustainability over time. Monitoring the degree to which guideline adherence is achieved at the patient level over time is critical. 63 Table 3.

Supportive services in oncology The supportive care that breast-cancer patients need abandonment. For example, antinauseants and includes the management of physical symptoms antiemetics are essential medications for helping (pain) and relates to the psychosocial and spiritual patients to complete chemotherapy with tolerable aspects of care. While resource constraints can side effects (Annex). limit access to these services, the delivery of supportive services should not be viewed as optional. On the contrary, supportive services Supportive services following are essential to patient compliance and effective treatment care delivery during treatment, as well as to recovery The increasing success of breast-cancer therapies following therapy (Fig. 20) means that a large global population of women is impacted by the long-term sequelae of their breast-cancer treatment. Breast-cancer survivors Supportive services during may experience long-term treatment complications treatment and must live with the risk of cancer recurrence (73). During treatment, breast-cancer patients need addition, they often experience psychosocial supportive care, including the management of complications that require supportive-care treatment-related toxicities. In addition, these services (74). Monitoring and support services patients have educational, psychosocial, and should, therefore, be available for and accessible spiritual needs (72).

Major improvements in breast-cancer outcomes can be achieved through directed interventions based on health-system performance, as measured by the GBCI KPIs for each Pillar. Investing in data systems and embedding monitoring and evaluation into programme implementation allow stakeholders to determine the extent to which a programme or project is on track towards meeting its goals. Performing a root cause analysis (RCA) to investigate underlying aetiologies relating to the KPI and three-pillar approach enables stakeholders to tailor effective PPIILLLLAARR 11 implementation strategies. RCAs can reveal relationships among different variables and underlying causes, leading to process deficits. The GBCI Framework provides explicit guidance on how RCA can facilitate directed policy and programmatic responses to address specific deficits in health systems for breast-cancer control. 74 75 Implementation planning Major improvements in breast-cancer outcomes can be achieved if it is possible to correct health-system performance as measured by the GBCI KPIs. In the WHO stepwise approach to cancer control, four essential questions need to be asked and answered in implementation planning (77).

Breast cancer has become the most diagnosed form of cancer globally and is the leading cause of cancer deaths among women. No ministry of health can overlook breast cancer if they intend to address cancer as a significant public health issue in their country. This GBCI Implementation Framework provides national programme managers, policy-makers, and multisectoral actors the guidance they need to assess, strengthen and scale-up services for the early detection and management of breast cancer. Using this Framework, all stakeholders can achieve the Initiative’s goal, namely, to assure the feasibility and quality of national health systems by providing countries with evidence-based recommendations for a phased approach to implementing interventions and strengthening health systems towards UHC. This approach to health-system strengthening should be viewed in the broader context of women’s health throughout the life continuum because the services and infrastructure required to manage breast cancer are also needed to deal with other malignancies and NCDs. A health system that can manage breast cancer will find itself better able to address all cancers that depend on early detection, prompt diagnosis and effective multimodality therapy. Because so much is known about the proper management of breast cancer, and because the pathways to tackling it are so well worked out, this provides an opportunity to improve health systems in a resource-appropriate way. Such an approach can be embraced as a tool for improving global health at a level higher than ever before. 82 83 ©WHO 82 83 References 1 Fox S, Speirs V. Shaaban A.M.

Anti-cancer medicines for breast cancer and WHO Model List of Essential Medicines 2021 Anti-cancer medicine regimens for breast-cancer treatment are selected for individual patients as determined by tumour-marker expression that defines four distinct breast-cancer subtypes (luminal A, luminal B, triple- negative, HER-2+) (1). Standard regimens (Table A1) use predetermined combinations, doses, and sequences of medicines (Table A2) (endocrine therapy, chemotherapy and targeted therapy) based on well-studied combination regimens that have been shown to reduce breast-cancer mortality (2,3). Principles of anti-cancer medication selection for different breast cancer subtypes 1) Hormone-receptor positive (ER+) breast cancers (luminal A or luminal B subtypes) are treated primarily with endocrine (hormone) therapies:1 a) Premenopausal: Tamoxifen, which can be augmented with the addition of a luteinizing hormone- releasing hormone analogue to block ovarian hormone production ; Postmenopausal: Anastrozole (aromatase inhibitor) +/- tamoxifen ; b) chemotherapy,2 which is considered in addition to endocrine therapy for advanced-stage, higher- risk premenopausal or postmenopausal ER+ cancers. 2) Hormone-receptor (ER and PR) negative AND HER-2 negative (triple-negative subtype): a) chemotherapy;1, 3 b) endocrine therapy is NOT RECOMMENDED for hormone-receptor negative breast cancers. 3) HER2+ breast cancer: a) chemotherapy;1, 2 b) endocrine therapy IS RECOMMENDED (in addition to chemotherapy) for hormone-receptor positive HER2+ cancers; c) trastuzumab-based targeted therapy regimens (in addition to chemotherapy) are preferred but may be cost-prohibitive.4 1 Anti-depressants may be needed to relieve hormone-therapy-related side effects, and/or manage symptoms of depression. 2 Chemotherapy regimen selection for non-metastatic cancer (neoadjuvant, or adjuvant) is based on high-level evidence but can be modified in cases of risk of relapse, comorbidities, toxicity profile, and patient preference. 3 Chemotherapy for metastatic disease selection and sequencing (monotherapy or combination regimens) is individualized based on disease presentation (visceral crisis, and/or symptoms), toxicity profile, comorbidities and patient preference. 4 The cost of targeted biological therapies can be prohibitive, making the risk-benefit something that needs to be considered on an individual basis. 90 91 Standard chemotherapy regimens Table A1. Standard chemotherapy regimens using medicines that are included in the WHO essential medicine list, 20215 Combination Anti-cancer medicinesb Interval Cycles regimena TC Docetaxel; Every 3 weeks 4 cycles Cyclophosphamide AC-T Doxorubicin, Cyclophosphamide, AC: Every 3 weeks AC x 4 cycles Paclitaxel T: weekly or every 3 followed by weeks T x 12 cycles CMF Cyclophosphamide; methotrexate, Every 4 weeks 6 cycles fluorouracil FAC Fluorouracil; Every 3 weeks 6 cycles Doxorubicin; and Cyclophosphamide FEC Fluorouracil; Every 3 weeks 6 cycles Epirubicin; and Cyclophosphamide TH Paclitaxel + Trastuzumab T: weekly T x12 cycles H: every 1 or 3 weeks H: 12 months Concurrent a ACT-H Doxorubicin; Cyclophosphamide; AC: every 3 weeks AC x 4 cycles Paclitaxel; T-H concurrent: weekly followed by Trastuzumab or every 3 weeks T x 12 cycles H: 12 months TC-H Docetaxel; Carboplatin; Trastuzumab TC: every 3 weeks TC: x6 cycles H: every 3 weeks H: 12 months a Well-established chemotherapy multidrug regimens are commonly known by standard abbreviations based on brand names rather than generic names. For example, TC = Taxol (decetaxel) + Cycophosphamide; TH = Taxotere (paclitaxel) + Herceptin (trastuzumab). b Supportive medications are equally important to the anti-cancer chemotherapeutic medicines. Because nausea and vomiting are common side effects of chemotherapy, anti-emetics prophylaxis is considered to be best practice, because they reduce nausea and vomiting, improves quality of life, and potentially reduces treatment abandonment. Source: NCCN Guidelines (3). Other supportive medications are considered essential for the management of breast cancer, including filgrastim to stimulate the production of white blood cell when cell counts are low, and zoledronic acid to treat bone thinning (osteoporosis) that can be caused by aromatase inhibitors. 5 World Health Organization model list of essential medicines, 22nd list, 2021 (4). 90 91 Table A2.

Advanced breast cancer with distant organ metastases is considered incurable with currently available therapies. On the molecular level, breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease; molecular features include activation of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2, encoded by ERBB2), activation of hormone receptors (oestrogen receptor and progesterone receptor) and/or BRCA mutations. Treatment strategies differ according to molecular subtype. Management of breast cancer is multidisciplinary ; it includes locoregional (surgery and radiation therapy) and systemic therapy approaches. Systemic therapies include endocrine therapy for hormone receptor-p ositive disease, chemotherapy , anti-H ER2 therapy for HER2-positive disease, bone stabilizing agents, poly(ADP-r ibose) polymerase inhibitors for BRCA mutation carriers and, quite recently, immunotherapy. Future therapeutic concepts in breast cancer aim at individualization of therapy as well as at treatment de-e scalation and escalation based on tumour biology and early therapy response. Next to further treatment innovations, equal worldwide access to therapeutic advances remains the global challenge in breast cancer care for the future. Breast cancer is the most frequent malignancy in women alterations that drive breast carcinogenesis are many, and is a heterogeneous disease on the molecular level. and several classifications have been developed to Over the past 10–15 years, treatment concepts have group tumours accordingly. The intrinsic classification evolved to take this heterogeneity into account, with of Perou and Sorlie1, reported in 2000, distinguished emphasis being placed on more biologically- directed four subtypes of breast cancer: luminal A and luminal B therapies and treatment de- escalation to reduce the (expressing the oestrogen receptor (ER)), basal-l ike and adverse effects of treatment.

The immune reaction to breast cancer is initiated by the neoantigens expressed by tumour cells, encoded by altered genes and presented by antigen-p resenting cells (APCs) on major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) or MHC II molecules. Neoantigen presentation results in activation of CD8+ (cytotoxic) and CD4+ (helper) T cells. CD8+ T cells are the main effector cell of the anti-t umour immune response; their activation (principally through the T cell receptor (TCR)) results in release of the cytolytic molecules perforin and granzyme B, which directly induce tumour cell lysis. The anti-t umour action of CD8+ T cells is amplified by cytokines secreted from CD4+ T cells, namely IFNγ, IL-2 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF). Activated CD8+ T cells also upregulate expression of Fas ligand (FasL) and TNF-r elated apoptosis-i nducing ligand (TRAIL; also known as TNFSF10) on their membrane, which induce apoptotic pathways to kill tumour cells. Cancer cells elicit an innate immune response, comprising natural killer (NK) and NK T cells that are capable of direct tumour cell killing. Malignant cells can suppress the immune response by expressing immune checkpoint regulators (for example, cytotoxic T lymphocyte-a ssociated protein 4 (CTL A-4) and programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L 1)), which are upregulated by effector T cells as a consequence of chronic exposure to tumour antigens (T cell exhaustion). The reduced anti-t umour immune response by upregulated immune checkpoint molecules establishes a pro-t umour microenvironment, which is further enriched by recruitment of immunosuppressive cells, T regulatory (T ) cells and myeloid-d erived stromal cells (MDSCs). T cells, which inhibit activation of CD4+ and CD8+ reg reg T cells, are induced by tumour-a ssociated macrophages (TAMs) and by tumour-s ecreted and cancer-a ssociated fibroblast (CAF)-secreted factors, such as transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ). In addition, TAMs and T cells inhibit APCs via IL-10 reg secretion, inducing a tolerogenic state of APCs. MDSCs are recruited to the tumour bed by tumour-s ecreted factors, inhibit trafficking of T cells to the tumour bed and inhibit effector T cell activation by upregulating 2,3-indoleamine- dioxygenase (IDO) and arginase expression, enzymes involved in the T cell nutrient depletion. The secretome of the pro-t umour microenvironment, containing factors that stimulate angiogenesis and invasion (such as vascular-e ndothelial growth factor (VEGF) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)) also contribute to tumour immune escape and propagation.

Efficacy of mammography screen- ing is age- dependent and is most evident in women a b 50–69 years of age, with weaker evidence of benefit in those outside this range89. Observational studies con- ducted in real-w orld screening practice provide similar evidence on the benefit of mammography screening to randomized controlled trials, although estimates of effect are heterogeneous90,91. Given that screening improves early detection of breast cancer, an expected benefit is a reduction in more intensive treatment, for example lower mastectomy rates. However, population- level studies have shown conflicting reports regarding the effect of screening on treatment92,93. Mammography screening has been implemented in the majority of developed health systems (for exam- ple, in the United States, United Kingdom, Europe and c d Australia), although the organization of screening ser- vices and uptake (participation) by women vary consid- erably between countries94. Southeast Asian countries implemented mammography screening later than European countries and several Asian countries have only partial screening programmes94. Nations with lim- ited resources (for example, sub- Saharan African and east African countries), where women often present with more- advanced cancers, have not implemented mammography screening and this reflects the generally limited health services infrastructure. Debate is ongoing regarding whether the harms associated with mammography screening outweigh its potential benefit in reducing breast cancer deaths, with Fig. 4 | Breast cancer imaging.

Secretory carcinomas harbour a specific translocation t(12;15) leading to a fusion gene NTRK3–ETV6 (reF.326), whereas the adenoid cystic carcinoma is characterized by t(6;9) and the fusion gene MYB–NFIB327. Understanding these features may help in the design of tailored therapeutics for particular histological subtypes324. ER , oestrogen receptor ; HER2, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2.

Management of early breast cancer is based on tumour burden and subtype. All patients with oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive disease receive adjuvant endocrine therapy after surgery. If patients are at high risk of recurrence (for example, owing to high-r isk gene expression signature results with 0–3 involved lymph nodes, involvement of ≥4 lymph nodes or a >10% risk of breast cancer-s pecific mortality at 10 years)130, chemotherapy needs to be recommended as well. In triple-n egative and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive early breast cancer, neoadjuvant subtype-s pecific systemic therapy is standard, followed by surgery. In the case that pathological complete response (pCR) is not achieved, systemic therapy can be escalated. Bisphosphonates are an additional adjuvant therapy option for all postmenopausal patients and premenopausal patients receiving ovarian suppression; they also conserve bone density. If indicated, radiation therapy can be administered after surgery. The management algorithm takes evidence-b ased registered therapy options into account.

However, the benefits in terms of any recur- rences, including distant metastases, show a complex interaction with the risk factors of the primary tumour and the effectiveness of the adjuvant systemic therapy162.

The most frequent nodal site is the axillary lymph nodes and the frequency of involvement depends on the size of the tumour. 10–40% of breast cancers have metastasis in the internal mammary chain, influenced by the topography of the tumour in the breast (inner quadrant versus outer quadrant and the size). Controversy abounds with regard to the value of staging and treatment of these nodes, for example, whether or not they need to be dealt with surgically or by radiation therapy. Breast cancer hones to distant metastatic sites differentially according to the molecular subtype according to data from the US Surveillance, Epidemiology , and End Results Program (SEER) database (data from 2010 to 2014, 295,213 patients with invasive breast cancer). Locoregional lymphatic spread is less frequent in triple-n egative breast cancer (TNBC) than in other subtypes. The opposite is true for brain metastases, which are more frequent in TNBC than luminal tumours. Additionally , metastatic disease occurs at different time points in the natural history ; for example, luminal A cancers typically show late metastatic occurrence (5–10 years after diagnosis) and long survival is possible. By contrast, basal-l ike subtypes usually metastasize within 2 years, and long survival durations are uncommon.

Management of advanced breast cancer with distant metastases should be according to subtype as well as disease characteristics and patient preferences. Supportive, palliative and psychosocial support are crucial from the time of diagnosis. Biopsy of a metastatic site and assessment of oestrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status, at least once in the metastatic setting, are also necessary. Endocrine therapy , with or without targeted therapy , is the mainstay for luminal-l ike disease, and — unless life-t hreatening — several lines are to be used before commencing chemotherapy. When chemotherapy is used, sequential monotherapy is advised. For triple-n egative disease, chemotherapy is the main treatment, with no specific recommendations except that platinum is one of the preferred options. Triple-n egative tumours with immune cells expressing programmed death-l igand 1 (PD-L 1) may be candidates for first-l ine immunotherapy. For HER2-positive disease, it is crucial to continue blocking the HER2 pathway , with a sequence of anti-H ER2 agents and chemotherapy ; combinations of endocrine therapy with anti-H ER2 therapy can also be used in ER-p ositive, HER2-positive disease, preferentially as maintenance therapy. For women harbouring germline BRCA mutations, poly(ADP-r ibose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors are an additional therapy option.

Different membrane receptor inhibitors have shown activity in breast cancer, including monoclonal antibodies against human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), such as trastuzumab, margetuximab and pertuzumab; antibody–drug conjugates, such as ado-t rastuzumab emtansine (T-D M1); immunotherapy that blocks programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) and/or programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L 1), such as atezolizumab and pembrolizumab; or drugs that target angiogenesis (such as the monoclonal antibody bevacizumab, which targets vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)). Tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as lapatinib, neratinib or tucatinib, among others, have shown activity in breast cancers that overexpress HER2. These drugs can block the activation of different signalling pathways such as the RAS–RAF–mitogen-a ctivated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway or the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)–protein kinase B (AKT)–mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway , which can also be blocked with small molecules such as everolimus or different PI3K inhibitors; the crosstalk between these pathways is an area of active research. Additionally , different poly(ADP-r ibose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors in patients with germline BRCA mutation-a ssociated breast cancer have demonstrated good activity.
