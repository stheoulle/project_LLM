About the NCCN Guidelines for Patients®
Did you know that top cancer centers across the United
States work together to improve cancer care? This
alliance of leading cancer centers is called the National
Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN®).
Cancer care is always changing. NCCN develops
evidence-based cancer care recommendations used by health care providers
worldwide. These frequently updated recommendations are the NCCN Clinical
Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®). The NCCN Guidelines for
Patients plainly explain these expert recommendations for people with cancer
and caregivers.
These NCCN Guidelines for Patients are based on the NCCN
Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®)
for Breast Cancer, Version 3.2025 – March 18, 2025.

and radiation therapy is possible for a
locoregional recurrence. Systemic and
endocrine therapy options are based on
hormone receptor (HR) and HER2 status,
and any mutations found.
 An unresectable tumor cannot be
removed with surgery. Unresectable
recurrent disease is treated as metastatic
disease with systemic therapy.
