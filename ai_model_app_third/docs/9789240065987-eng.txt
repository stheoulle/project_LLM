Global Breast Cancer Initiative
Implementation Framework
Assessing, strengthening and scaling
up services for the early detection and
management of breast cancer
Abstract
Breast cancer is the most common cancer worldwide and the leading cause of cancer deaths among women, disproportionately
affecting individuals in low- and middle-income countries. Breast-cancer five-year survival rates in high-income countries
exceed 90%, compared with 66% in India and 40% in South Africa. The WHO Global Breast Cancer Initiative (GBCI), established
in 2021, has set the goal to reduce breast cancer mortality by 2.5% per year, which over a 20-year period would save
2.5 million lives.
This GBCI Implementation Framework provides national programme managers, policy makers and multisectoral actors
the guidance needed to assess, strengthen and scale-up services for the early detection and management of breast cancer.
The Framework presents key strategies using three pillars:
• Pillar 1. Health promotion for early detection (prevention and pre-diagnostic interval)
• Pillar 2. Timely breast diagnostics (diagnostic interval)
• Pillar 3. Comprehensive breast-cancer management (treatment interval).
Implementation strategies are specified, which include how governments can operationalize this Framework to improve access
to breast-cancer services in their settings. Using this Framework, all stakeholders can achieve the Initiative’s goal to assure
feasibility and quality by providing evidence-based recommendations for a phased approach to implementing interventions
and strengthen health systems towards the attainment of universal health coverage.

Glossary of terms
Age-standardized mortality rates
An age-standardized mortality rate is the weighted average of the age-specific mortality rates per
100 000 population , where the weights represent the proportions of people in the corresponding age-groups
of the WHO standard population.
Benefit-to-cost ratio1
This is the ratio of project benefits to project costs. It involves adding up the total discounted benefits gained
by a project over its entire duration/life span and dividing it over the total discounted costs of the project 1.
[Σ B/ (1+d)i]
BCR = i added up over 1 = 0 to n years
[ΣC / (1+d)i]
i
Where: Bi = the project’s benefit in year i, where i = 0 to n years Ci = the project’s costs in year i, where i = 0 to
n years, n = the total number of years of project duration/life span, d = the discount rate.
Breast-cancer-control programmes
A breast-cancer prevention-and-control programme comprises an organized set of activities aimed at
preventing and reducing morbidity and mortality from breast cancer. A comprehensive programme includes a
plan of action specifying the work to be done, those responsible, timelines, and resources for implementation.
In addition, it describes the evidence-based interventions needed to reduce the high and unequal burden
that breast cancer imposes on women and health systems in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).
Breast self-examination (BSE)
BSE is a visual and tactile examination of the breast performed by the individual to assess the presence of
persistent changes or abnormalities, thereby helping the individual learn over time what looks and feels
normal for her. During a BSE, the individual inspects her breasts in the mirror, looking for asymmetries,
puckering, dimpling, or localized skin changes, then feels the entire breast and armpits with the arm and
shoulder extended to flatten the breast on the chest wall.
Clinical breast assessment (CBA)
CBA refers to the set of clinical tools essential for the early diagnosis of breast cancer at the primary-care
level. To conduct a CBA, a provider takes a medical history to learn what changes (if any) the patient has
noted in the breast, such as lumps, thickenings, asymmetries, or skin changes, as well as the time course over
which these changes have occurred. The provider then performs a general medical examination, including
a clinical breast examination (CBE) (see below) to correlate the historical findings with those present on
physical examination. The findings of the CBA are used by the clinician to formulate a differential diagnosis,
request diagnostic imaging, and determine if tissue sampling (biopsy) is warranted.

xii
Clinical breast examination (CBE)
CBE is a systematic and specific clinical examination of the breast, the nipples, and the areola, axillary,
infraclavicular and supraclavicular lymph nodes, performed by a health-care provider. Abnormal findings on
CBE generally warrant diagnostic imaging and may require tissue sampling to make a definitive diagnosis.
CBE, which is required for CBA, is performed in conjunction with breast-cancer early-diagnosis programmes
and can be deployed as part of a breast-cancer screening programme.
Clinical (care) process
Clinical processes or clinical-care processes encompass all health-care provider activities and other
prescribed health-care activities that are implemented to address identified or specified health issues. These
involve the GBCI Breast Cancer Care Pathway, which is a series of clinical-care processes grouped into three
sequential intervals (pre-diagnostic, diagnostic and treatment) in alignment with the three GBCI Pillars to
facilitate early detection, diagnosis and management of breast abnormalities and cancers.
Early detection
Early detection is the overall process whereby breast cancer is detected at earlier stages (0, I or II) when
treatment is on average more effective. Early detection requires “early-diagnosis” approaches among the
general population and may include “screening” a prespecified subgroup of individuals without breast
symptoms. Both early diagnosis and screening programmes achieve “stage shifting” in which a greater
fraction of breast cancers in the population is diagnosed at earlier stages of disease progression. The goal of
an early detection breast-cancer programme is to promote stage shifting so that >60% of women diagnosed
with invasive breast cancer have stages I or II disease.
Early diagnosis programme
Breast cancer early-diagnosis programmes are the initial step in establishing a breast-cancer early-detection
programme. To facilitate breast cancer early diagnosis, individuals with early, subtle symptoms of breast
cancer are encouraged to seek care and undergo evaluation and definitive diagnostic work-ups (imaging
+/- tissue sampling) to determine which individuals have cancer and which do not. Distinct from screening
programmes of women without symptoms, where testing is limited to a prespecified age group at heightened
risk of breast cancer, all individuals with breast-cancer symptoms warrant evaluation, regardless of age. The
goal of early-diagnosis programmes is to implement clinical approaches so that >60% of women found to
have invasive breast cancer have stages I or II disease.
Mammogram
A mammogram is an X-ray examination (radiogram) of the breast, including multiple views of one or both
breasts. It is used to detect and diagnose breast disease in women who have breast problems, such as a lump,
pain, or nipple discharge (diagnostic mammogram), and in women with no breast complaints (screening
mammogram).
Mammography
Mammography comprises the radiology and diagnostic-imaging services that are devoted to the practice
of mammography. It involves a combination of equipment and human resources aimed at applying low-
energy X-rays to the examination of breasts. Regardless of whether mammography is used for screening or
diagnostic purposes, a quality-assurance programme is required to maximize the benefits and minimize the
harms associated with this procedure.
Metastatic breast cancer (MBC)
MBC refers to the spread of the primary breast tumour from the breast through the circulation and lymphatics
to distant sites and organs, most often bone, lung, liver and brain. Advanced breast cancers (ABCs) may
initially present with distant metastases (MBC stage IV) or may recur with distant metastases following initial
treatment (metastatic recurrence of stages I – III disease).
xiii
Monitoring
This involves the systematic collection of data for measuring the achievements of breast-cancer-control
programmes, which are assessed periodically, using a set of measurable indicators.
Multimodality treatment
Multimodality treatment is prescribed for patients on an individualized basis, utilizing multiple modes
of therapy (surgery, radiation therapy, anti-cancer medication) to minimize the risk of cancer recurrence.
Specific treatment programmes are determined in alignment with evidence-based cancer guidelines, based
on the cancer’s biological features and the extent and stage of the disease.
Screening programme
A breast-cancer-screening programme is a public health, early-detection approach whereby women without
known signs or symptoms of breast cancer are invited, on a repetitive basis, to undergo testing for cancer
before it causes recognizable signs or symptoms. To consistently find cancer at early stages of the disease,
the screening test must be repeated in the same individuals at regular intervals (every 1–2 years). To avoid
excessively high numbers of false-positive test results, the subgroup of individuals invited for screening
should be limited to those whose degree of breast-cancer risk exceeds a prespecified risk threshold.
Screening-selection criteria are based primarily on age and gender and secondarily on other recognized
risk factors, including genetic or familial risk, reproductive history and breast density.
Stage shifting
This is the shifting at diagnosis from one stage to the stage below, or the diagnosis of cancer earlier in the
stage. This is often a result of early-detection programmes.
Systemic (anti-cancer medicine) therapy/treatment
Systemic anti-cancer therapies are a group of medicines prescribed to kill cancer cells that have spread
beyond the primary tumour. Standardized multi-medication treatment regimens are individually prescribed
based on breast-cancer subtyping as determined by tumour-marker testing (ER, PR and HER2 expression)
and may include cytotoxics/chemotherapy, endocrine (hormonal) treatments, and/or targeted (or biological)
therapies. Systemic therapy is given in conjunction with other therapeutic interventions to control disease
in the breast and lymph-node beds (surgery and radiotherapy). Systemic anti-cancer therapies can be
administered following (adjuvant) or prior to (neoadjuvant) surgical resection of the primary breast tumour.
Supportive services
Supportive services are an essential component of cancer management for patients at all stages of the
disease, including the management of physical symptoms resulting from cancer and its treatment (pain,
nausea, hair loss, fatigue, lymphedema), some of which can be long-lasting. Supportive services also address
the psychosocial and spiritual challenges that cancer and its treatments can trigger (anxiety, depression,
feelings of social isolation).
Treatment completion
Treatment completion means the fulfilment of all components or steps of the therapeutic sequence, unless
interruption is indicated for medical reasons.
Treatment abandonment
Treatment abandonment refers to the failure to complete the treatment regimen for reasons other than
medical indications for treatment disruption.

This framework requires:
policy-makers to assess policies related to health-

health-care administrators to recognize system gaps for
which they need resources and personnel to perform
required tasks within appropriate timeframes;
clinicians to define and explain the services they need

community-based organizations and patient and
advocacy groups to define the services they require

Key performance indicators for the three GBCI pillars
To improve existing health-care delivery systems, it is necessary to monitor programme
input, output, and outcomes to determine possible gaps in care delivery. Three
evidence-based key performance indicators (KPIs) have been proposed to identify
where these may exist (Table 1).

Key messages from this chapter
What is breast cancer?
Health promotion for early detection focuses on improving the
understanding of the public and health-care professionals of
breast-cancer risk factors and symptoms.
Health promotion for early detection focuses on improving the
understanding of the public and health-care professionals of
breast-cancer risk factors and symptoms.
Early detection is founded on breast-health awareness as part of early-diagnosis
programmes. These programmes focus on identifying people with signs and symptoms
suggesting malignancy and facilitating access to cancer diagnostic services. All health-
care systems require the capacity to diagnose symptomatic breast complaints, such as
lumps, thickenings, or other clinically detectable abnormalities.
Breast-cancer screening (an alternate early-detection programmatic strategy in which
women in a target age group are invited to undergo testing yearly or every other year)
may be an aspirational goal once health-system prerequisites have been established.
However, organized, population-based screening is not an appropriate or practical
initial step in any setting until the required infrastructure and quality-control measures
are in place and fully functional.
The KPI for Pillar 1 is >60% of invasive cancers to be stage I or II at
diagnosis. No country has achieved a sustained decline in breast-cancer
mortality rates of 2% per year or more for at least three consecutive
years without also achieving a level of early detection where 60% of
patients present with stage I or II disease.

Box 9. The role of BSE in the early
detection of breast cancer
BSE is an examination performed by the individual, which includes
inspecting the breast in the mirror and feeling the entire breast and
armpits, the arm in use being extended to flatten the breast on the
chest wall.
BSE plays a key role in breast-health awareness by helping the
individual to know what feels normal. This is a prerequisite for being
able to assess where new findings, such as lumps, thickenings, or
other persistent changes might represent abnormalities.
While BSE has not been found to improve breast-cancer detection
among women who undergo routine mammographic screening, over
90% of breast cancers are self-detected in those who do not.
A randomized study of BSE in Shanghai, China, did not show an
improvement in breast-cancer survival in women who had been
formally trained in BSE versus those who had not. However, it did
show that those in the untrained (control) group were already good
at identifying small cancers (less than 2cm) (27).
Breast health awareness should continue to be encouraged. Women
who through BSE identify persistent findings that feel abnormal

Box 10. The role of CBE in the early
detection of breast cancer
CBE is required for CBA if the clinician can correlate the findings
from the patient’s history, BSE, and diagnostic imaging to formulate
a differential diagnosis and determine a diagnostic plan for a given
breast abnormality.
The goal of breast-cancer early-diagnosis programmes is to correctly
diagnose breast cancers early in their course when the signs and
symptoms of disease can be subtle. Thus, CBE is the cornerstone
for evaluating breast findings in patients who present with
self-appreciated breast complaints that could represent cancer.
CBE has not been shown to improve breast-cancer early detection
when used in conjunction with mammographic screening. However,
CBE has been successfully used as a screening test in previously
unscreened populations and has been shown to promote favourable
stage shifting (29). One study demonstrated a survival benefit in
women aged 50 years and older (30).
Box 11. What is the evidence of a stage-
shifting threshold in breast cancer?
IHO performed a population-based analysis to determine the degree
of early-stage diagnosis associated with improved breast-cancer
survival at the national level.
Among 35 countries with adequate breast-cancer TNM-stage
distribution data and longitudinal survival data by year, 20 had
achieved sustained reductions in breast-cancer mortality (>2% annual
mortality reduction for three consecutive years); 15 had not.
In each of the 20 countries that had achieved sustained
reductions in breast-cancer mortality, at least 60% of patients
with invasive breast-cancer presented as stages I or II disease.
Some of these countries had population-based mammographic
screening programmes.

Box 12. When should a country set up a
mammographic screening programme?
The decision to start a mammographic screening programme is
a nuanced one that each country must base on an individualized
strategic assessment. In appropriately selected countries, it may
be necessary to begin screening in urban areas, and subsequently
extend it to rural areas where access is more limited.
Having accessible diagnostic imaging and tissue-sampling services
(breast ultrasound, diagnostic MG, needle biopsy) in place is
mandatory before any breast-cancer-screening efforts can be
contemplated (GBCI Pillar 2).
Mammographic-screening programmes are highly resource intensive
regarding both initiation and sustainment. Beyond the purchase of
MG machines, running effective screening programmes requires a
trained workforce, quality-control systems, and data-management
systems to keep a track of the patients through repeated
mammographic studies over time.
A screen-detected cancer is one that was not seen on a prior
mammogram but has become apparent on a current mammogram.
Thus, to achieve stage shifting, mammographic screening requires
that studies of the same women in the target group be repeated
every 1–2 years.
When the majority of breast-cancer patients present with locally
advanced breast cancer (LABC) or metastatic breast cancer (MBC) that
can be detected through CBE, the focus needs to be on establishing
early-diagnosis programmes. This will promote favourable stage
shifting at a significantly lower cost (24,34).

The diagnostic
interval
Key messages from this chapter
What is breast cancer?
Timely breast diagnostics require a series of coordinated services for definitive
cancer diagnosis and staging.
The diagnostic interval represents the intermediate period between referral for
a diagnostic work-up and the time that a definitive benign or malignant diagnosis
is made.
Delays from first presentation to the health-care system to breast-cancer diagnosis
(diagnostic-interval delays) are associated with a greater likelihoPIoLdLA oRf 1late-stage
diagnosis and lower chance of breast-cancer survival.
Interventions to promote timely breast diagnostics include organizing services
to increase access. If it is not feasible to fully decentralize imaging and pathology
services, well-organized sample-transport systems and information systems
can effectively decentralize sample collections, while minimizing patient travel
and still enabling critical results to be obtained in a reasonable timeframe.
The KPI for Pillar 2 is for breast cancers to be diagnosed within 60 days
(two months) of initial presentation to a health-care system.

The diagnostic interval (Pillar 2) represents the intermediate period
between referral for a diagnostic work-up and the time that a definitive

Key messages from this chapter
What is breast cancer?
Comprehensive breast-cancer management includes receiving and completing quality-
assured cancer-directed therapies (surgery, radiotherapy, and systemic “anti-cancer”
treatment), combined with supportive management in an integrated care model.
The treatment interval represents the episode when patients
receive definitive care.
Treatment completion can be defined as the fulfilment of all components or steps
of the therapeutic sequence unless there is an interruption for mPeILdLiAcRa l1 reasons.
Incomplete treatment can lead to poorer patient outcomes, including worsened
survival, and reduced quality of life.
Directed actions can promote treatment completion and reduce abandonment,
according to a local context, by addressing patient- and system-related barriers.
Provision of guideline-directed and supportive services are essential components of
comprehensive breast-cancer services.
The KPI for Pillar 3 is that >80% of patients receive their recommended
treatment to completion without abandonment.

Box 20. Why are cancer-management
guidelines important?
Providing access to standardized guideline-based management
is necessary to improve guideline compliance and reduce
breast-cancer mortality.
Cancer guidelines can only help improve cancer outcomes if the care
described in the guidelines can be delivered to completion without
significant interruption.
High-quality, evidence-based guidelines are available from HICs, but
generally need to be adapted to existing services and resources.
Guideline adaptation to existing services and affordable care
(resource stratification) is necessary in resource-constrained settings
to ensure sustainability over time.
Monitoring the degree to which guideline adherence is achieved at
the patient level over time is critical.

Implementation
strategies for
success
Key messages from this chapter
What is breast cancer?
Major improvements in breast-cancer outcomes can be achieved through directed
interventions based on health-system performance, as measured by the GBCI KPIs
for each Pillar.
Investing in data systems and embedding monitoring and evaluation into programme
implementation allow stakeholders to determine the extent to which a programme or
project is on track towards meeting its goals.
Performing a root cause analysis (RCA) to investigate underlying aetiologies
relating to the KPI and three-pillar approach enables stakeholders to tailor effective
PPIILLLLAARR 11
implementation strategies. RCAs can reveal relationships among different variables
and underlying causes, leading to process deficits.
The GBCI Framework provides explicit guidance
on how RCA can facilitate directed policy and
programmatic responses to address specific
deficits in health systems for breast-cancer control.

Implementation planning
Major improvements in breast-cancer outcomes can be achieved if it is possible
to correct health-system performance as measured by the GBCI KPIs. In the
WHO stepwise approach to cancer control, four essential questions need to
be asked and answered in implementation planning (77).

Conclusions
What is breast cancer?
Breast cancer has become the most diagnosed form of cancer globally and is the
leading cause of cancer deaths among women. No ministry of health can overlook
breast cancer if they intend to address cancer as a significant public health issue
in their country.
This GBCI Implementation Framework provides national programme managers,
policy-makers, and multisectoral actors the guidance they need to assess,
strengthen and scale-up services for the early detection and management of
breast cancer. Using this Framework, all stakeholders can achieve the Initiative’s
goal, namely, to assure the feasibility and quality of national health systems by
providing countries with evidence-based recommendations for a phased approach
to implementing interventions and strengthening health systems towards UHC.
This approach to health-system strengthening should be viewed in the broader
context of women’s health throughout the life continuum because the services
and infrastructure required to manage breast cancer are also needed to deal with
other malignancies and NCDs. A health system that can manage breast cancer will
find itself better able to address all cancers that depend on early detection, prompt
diagnosis and effective multimodality therapy. Because so much is known about
the proper management of breast cancer, and because the pathways to tackling
it are so well worked out, this provides an opportunity to improve health systems
in a resource-appropriate way. Such an approach can be embraced as a tool for
improving global health at a level higher than ever before.

Annex. Anti-cancer
medicines for breast
cancer and WHO
Model List of Essential
Medicines 2021
Anti-cancer medicine regimens for breast-cancer treatment are selected for individual patients as determined
by tumour-marker expression that defines four distinct breast-cancer subtypes (luminal A, luminal B, triple-
negative, HER-2+) (1). Standard regimens (Table A1) use predetermined combinations, doses, and sequences
of medicines (Table A2) (endocrine therapy, chemotherapy and targeted therapy) based on well-studied
combination regimens that have been shown to reduce breast-cancer mortality (2,3).
Principles of anti-cancer medication selection for different breast cancer subtypes
1) Hormone-receptor positive (ER+) breast cancers (luminal A or luminal B subtypes) are treated
primarily with endocrine (hormone) therapies:1
a) Premenopausal: Tamoxifen, which can be augmented with the addition of a luteinizing hormone-
releasing hormone analogue to block ovarian hormone production ;
Postmenopausal: Anastrozole (aromatase inhibitor) +/- tamoxifen ;
b) chemotherapy,2 which is considered in addition to endocrine therapy for advanced-stage, higher-
risk premenopausal or postmenopausal ER+ cancers.
2) Hormone-receptor (ER and PR) negative AND HER-2 negative (triple-negative subtype):
a) chemotherapy;1, 3
b) endocrine therapy is NOT RECOMMENDED for hormone-receptor negative breast cancers.
3) HER2+ breast cancer:
a) chemotherapy;1, 2
b) endocrine therapy IS RECOMMENDED (in addition to chemotherapy) for hormone-receptor positive
HER2+ cancers;
c) trastuzumab-based targeted therapy regimens (in addition to chemotherapy) are preferred but
may be cost-prohibitive.4
1 Anti-depressants may be needed to relieve hormone-therapy-related side effects, and/or manage symptoms of depression.
2 Chemotherapy regimen selection for non-metastatic cancer (neoadjuvant, or adjuvant) is based on high-level evidence but can be modified in cases of
risk of relapse, comorbidities, toxicity profile, and patient preference.
3 Chemotherapy for metastatic disease selection and sequencing (monotherapy or combination regimens) is individualized based on disease presentation
(visceral crisis, and/or symptoms), toxicity profile, comorbidities and patient preference.
4 The cost of targeted biological therapies can be prohibitive, making the risk-benefit something that needs to be considered on an individual basis.

H: every 3 weeks H: 12 months
a Well-established chemotherapy multidrug regimens are commonly known by standard abbreviations based on brand names rather than generic names. For example,
TC = Taxol (decetaxel) + Cycophosphamide; TH = Taxotere (paclitaxel) + Herceptin (trastuzumab).
b Supportive medications are equally important to the anti-cancer chemotherapeutic medicines. Because nausea and vomiting are common side effects of
chemotherapy, anti-emetics prophylaxis is considered to be best practice, because they reduce nausea and vomiting, improves quality of life, and potentially
reduces treatment abandonment.
Source: NCCN Guidelines (3).
Other supportive medications are considered essential for the management of breast cancer, including
filgrastim to stimulate the production of white blood cell when cell counts are low, and zoledronic acid to
treat bone thinning (osteoporosis) that can be caused by aromatase inhibitors.

As measuring units, the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system and the Defined Daily
Dose (DDD) have become the gold standard for international drug utilization monitoring and research. The
ATC/DDD system is a tool for exchanging and comparing data on drug use at the international, national or
local levels (5).
