incidence rates increased among all racial and ethnic

decreased by 0.7% annually, and distant-stage disease
increased by 0.9% annually, from 7.3 per 100,000 in 2015

screening rates are similar between White and Black
women, Black women are more likely to be screened at
lower resourced and nonaccredited facilities and also to
experience longer intervals between mammograms and
between abnormal results and follow-up.27, 40-42 The Black-
White breast cancer mortality disparity continued to
widen through the 2000s as breast cancer treatment
improved, peaking in 2011 with rates in Black women
44% higher than those in Whites. In the most recent
period (2016-2020), the breast cancer death rate was 40%

Are there geographic differences in
breast cancer rates?
Table 3 shows variation in state-level breast cancer
incidence and death rates by race/ethnicity. Although the
national incidence rate for breast cancer remains slightly
higher in White women compared to Black women, rates
are higher in Black women in 4 of the 42 states with
sufficient data (Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and

states and the District of Columbia.
